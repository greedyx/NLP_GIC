0,2020-11-25,"popular trading platforms run by bank of america corp., td ameritrade holding corp. and vanguard group suffered glitches tuesday that rendered them inaccessible or slow to use, frustrating investors on a landmark day for the u.s. stock market.

the snafus began as markets opened at 9:30 a.m. et, before the dow jones industrial average surpassed 30000 for the first time, according to the tech-service tracker downdetector.users of bank of america's merrill edge platform shared screenshots indicating that its site was temporarily unavailable. mark chockalingam, an investor in sudbury, mass., said he was unable to log into merrill edge for about four hours.

mr. chockalingam said he was hoping to lock in a profit on call options he recently bought on energy companies including apache corp. and pioneer natural resources co., which had jumped in value after a rally in the price of oil.

""if the brokerage is out, i'll be out thousands of dollars, even though i made the right call,"" said mr. chockalingam, who runs a supply-chain-management consulting firm. he was later able to connect to merrill edge.

a bank of america spokesman said on tuesday afternoon: ""all systems are currently operating business as usual. earlier, some clients experienced a technical issue when trying to log into mymerrill and merrill edge.""

brokerage platforms run by td ameritrade -- including thinkorswim, which is popular with day traders -- suffered slowdowns at the start of the trading day, making it difficult to use its website or submit orders, users said.

""this morning, clients experienced a few minutes of slowness across our trading platforms at market open,"" said a spokeswoman for td ameritrade, which was recently acquired by charles schwab corp. ""the issue was quickly resolved.""

vanguard users also complained that the asset-management giant's website wasn't working properly. at 10:03 a.m. et, a twitter user named coleslaw_84 tweeted, ""website so slowwwwwwwwwww,"" spurring an apologetic response from vanguard.

a vanguard spokeswoman confirmed that some clients may have experienced difficulty navigating its website for individual investors. ""the issue is now resolved,"" she said. ""we apologize for the inconvenience and thank clients for their patience.""

u.s. stocks rallied after president trump signaled late monday that his administration would cooperate with president-elect joe biden to allow the presidential transition to go forward, removing a source of uncertainty that had dogged the market in recent weeks.

that triggered a huge increase in trading volume. some 2.9 billion shares of new york stock exchange- and nasdaq-listed stocks changed hands during the first half-hour of trading on tuesday, more than 80% higher than the average full-day volume this year, according to dow jones market data.

similar volume surges earlier this year have also caused problems for popular trading platforms. on nov. 9, glitches hit schwab, fidelity investments, vanguard, td ameritrade and webull financial llc during a surge in trading spurred by news that a covid-19 vaccine candidate bring developed by pfizer inc. and its partner biontech se was highly effective, according to early data.

1,2020-11-23,"the biggest banks in the u.s. will give black-owned businesses advantageous terms on a crucial type of financing that companies use to manage their cash flow, a novel effort to narrow the wealth gap between white and nonwhite communities.

banks made multibillion-dollar commitments to expand lending to black consumers and businesses after the wave of protests throughout the u.s sparked by the killing of george floyd. the targeted lending is meant to correct decades of discrimination in lending whereby banks denied loans to black borrowers or steered them toward products with high interest rates and other terms many couldn't afford.as part of those promises, citigroup inc., jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america corp. say they will lower charges to black- and other minority-owned companies in supply-chain finance programs. companies use supply-chain finance to manage short-term spending needs, similar to the way a consumer might use a credit card.

in a typical supply-chain finance deal, a bank will pay a company's supplier faster than the normal payment terms, which, depending on the industry, typically vary from 30 to 180 days. in return for getting paid early, the supplier agrees to receive slightly less than it would get by waiting, and pays the bank a fee.

the company pays back the bank the full amount down the road, improving its working capital by padding out the time it gets to hold on to its cash. the bank profits by keeping the difference between what it paid the supplier and what it received from the company.

as part of their diversity efforts, the banks will pay black-owned suppliers earlier than other customers or charge them lower fees, the banks say.

in most types of lending, the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act forbid lenders from making credit decisions based on race. that prevents banks from giving cheaper interest rates on mortgages, for example, to minority applicants.

in the supply-chain finance business, by contrast, the supplier isn't receiving a traditional loan. rather, the banks' financing relationship is with the company that buys the goods or services from the supplier. the client tells the banks which of its suppliers are eligible for preferential treatment. the banks then run checks to confirm the pool.

john e. harmon sr., president of the african american chamber of commerce of new jersey, said the programs would help black businesses grow faster and level the playing field. supplier diversity has become a frequent topic of discussion with companies and financial institutions since the racial-justice protests, he said.

banks have made efforts over the years to lend to black and other-minority owned businesses. but progress has been mixed, and those businesses often fail to get access to the key types of financing that grease the wheels of commerce.

a december report from the federal reserve bank of atlanta found that while nearly half of white-owned small businesses got approval for all the financing they applied for in 2018, only 31% of black-owned firms, 35% of hispanic-owned and 39% of asian-owned did.

in the wake of the protests, citigroup duplicated an existing supply-chain program that extends preferential pricing for suppliers who meet environmental, social and governance criteria like committing to upholding the paris climate agreement. the new program will focus on black-owned businesses, said ebru pakcan, global head of trade.

""you have the effect of being able to support black-owned businesses that are already in the marketplace,"" ms. pakcan said. ""if growth opportunities have not been at par with others, if they have been disadvantaged in other ways, we are now giving them an extra advantage.""

the first client to consider it is a large u.s. telecommunications company, whose program is likely to be implemented next year. the bank is initially targeting 150 suppliers of that client for improved terms or earlier payment, ms. pakcan said.

big users of supply-chain financing include blue-chip companies such as boeing co. and coca-cola co., which manage hundreds or thousands of suppliers at a time. the programs help companies conserve cash for longer. by paying suppliers earlier, it makes them more attractive to do business with.

supply-chain finance deals are private, and public companies aren't obliged to disclose them, so it is difficult to put a precise figure on the size of the business. but there may be more than $350 billion of invoices involved in the supply-chain finance technique known as reverse factoring, according to research firm aite group.

supply-chain financing spread after the financial crisis and has remained popular through the coronavirus pandemic. it comprises a small but growing part of banks' commercial banking operations. banks took in $12.7 billion in revenue during the first half of the year from supply-chain finance, up 3.6% from a year earlier, according to research firm coalition.

jpmorgan is crafting programs with better pricing for black- and other minority- and female-owned suppliers, propelled in part by corporate clients reaching out to the bank on the topic, said vasudha saxena, head of trade in jpmorgan's commercial bank. the bank in recent months has been working with retail and industrial clients on programs.

technology has helped widen the pool of suppliers. typically, onboarding supply-chain finance participants has been paper-intensive, making it difficult for small businesses without large treasury departments to enroll. new technology is easing the process and allowing more access, she said.

bank of america will use some of the proceeds from a $2 billion environmental, social and governance bond it issued in september to fund financing to minority-owned suppliers in the u.s. black and hispanic suppliers will get a discount on the rate the bank charges for supply-chain finance, said geoff brady, head of global trade and supply-chain finance.

the bank will target hundreds of suppliers in the next several months, he said. one goal of the program is for bank of america to get access to new, diverse clients with the hopes of banking them beyond supply-chain finance.

2,2020-10-15,"bank of america corp.'s profit fell 16% in the third quarter, though the bank indicated that it is well prepared to weather the coronavirus recession.

the charlotte, n.c., lender said wednesday that it earned $4.88 billion in the july-to-september period, compared with $5.78 billion a year ago and $3.53 billion in the prior quarter.profit amounted to 51 cents a share. analysts polled by factset had forecast 49 cents.

america's second-largest bank has struck a more optimistic tone than some of its rivals in recent months, saying that consumption is bouncing back after the initial shock of the economic shutdown. the bank said that its customers spent more in the third quarter than they did a year ago as the economy reopened.

""we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of a generally sound underlying economy but we won't get there until we have fully addressed the health-care crisis and its associated effects,"" chief executive brian moynihan said on a call with analysts.

while bank of america, like its peers, has put away billions of dollars to cover loan defaults, its provisions have been smaller. now, the bank and its competitors signaled they are holding off for now on more major reserve builds. jpmorgan chase & co. on tuesday said its profit rose from a year ago and citigroup inc. said its profit fell, but both banks set aside less additional money than in the previous two quarters for potential loan losses.

in the third quarter, bank of america set aside $1.39 billion.

that was far smaller than its earlier provision of $5.12 billion in the second quarter and $4.76 billion in the first quarter.

provisions included more money set aside for commercial loans in hard-hit industries such as travel and entertainment.

notably, the bank released $269 million of its reserves for consumer loan losses, saying credit-card balances are lower and the economy is improving.

the bank posted revenue of $20.34 billion in the third quarter, down 11% from last year.

analysts polled by factset had expected $20.8 billion. revenue was down in all of its divisions except trading.

adjusted trading revenue of $3.34 billion was up 4% from $3.22 billion a year ago. last quarter, the division posted revenue of $4.41 billion.

trading revenue jumped 30% at jpmorgan and 17% at citigroup, with traders taking advantage of uncertain markets.

the investment-banking arm posted fee growth of 15% from a year ago, led by underwriting of stock offerings during what has turned out to be a blockbuster few months for initial public offerings.

total fees of $1.77 billion compared with $1.53 billion a year earlier. however, the bank also booked lower fees from mergers and bond issuance.

superlow interest rates have presented another challenge for banks, eating into what they earn from lending money.

bank of america's interest income fell 17% from a year ago to $10.13 billion, while its noninterest income fell 4% to $10.21 billion.

bank of america shares fell 5.3% wednesday. bank stocks have tumbled this year, far underperforming the broader s&p 500, which is trading near record highs.

3,2020-08-29,"chinese companies are borrowing less from u.s. bond buyers, as the deep pools of dollars held by investors in asia means the region can be more self-reliant for hard-currency funding.

the long-running trend has gained pace in the past couple of years, especially for state-owned enterprises, or soes, that are controlled by china's central government.u.s. buyers took up just 11% of this year's chinese dollar bonds by value, bofa securities data through mid-august show, down from 20% last year. for central soes, the figure tumbled to 4%, from 10% last year and 15% in 2018. the figures don't include purchases by the international arms of u.s. asset managers, who might also buy some debt via units in asia.

""growing demand out of asia means that many chinese soe issuers no longer require u.s. investor involvement in order to get the best price,"" said mark reade, head of fixed income research for mizuho securities asia.

he added that virtual deal roadshows this year, due to the pandemic, might have also cut u.s. participation. in addition, mr. reade said earlier this year that many u.s. investors were more focused on the higher yields available in their own backyard, after a widespread market selloff.

the shift is partly because more chinese borrowers are choosing to sell new bonds in a format that requires less detailed financial disclosure. these are known as regulation-s or reg-s offerings, and apply only to offshore fundraising, rather than the 144a system that allows debt to be sold to investors inside the u.s.

so far this year, only 10% by value of the $119.6 billion in dollar bonds sold by chinese issuers made use of the more-stringent 144a system, dealogic data show. the proportion is broadly in line with last year, but down from 72% a decade ago, when 144a deals made up the majority of a much smaller overall market.

""some chinese issuers are wondering whether you really want to expose yourself to additional regulatory and political risks, or whether you really need to raise funding in the u.s. when that can be attained in asia,"" said ivy wong, asia pacific chair of baker mckenzie's capital markets practice.

ms. wong said given recent u.s.-china tensions, some u.s. investors might also not want to take on potential risks in participating in either debt or equity raisings by chinese companies.

thu ha chow, a portfolio manager at u.s. investment firm loomis sayle & co.'s asia office in singapore, said investors like her are demanding higher interest rates to invest in dollar bonds issued by chinese state-backed firms.

""we do expect to be paid a premium for chinese government dollar bonds due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as for the possibility that we can get scrutinized for our holdings in the future,"" ms. chow said.

for example, she said a chinese state-owned oil company would need to pay about 0.3 percentage point more in annual interest costs for a five-year bond than a privately owned u.s. energy company with similar credit ratings.

given bond yields are low, however, ms. chow said she expects u.s. investors would remain enthusiastic about buying such debt, particularly if heightened tensions between the u.s. and china led to even higher premiums.

the trump administration and lawmakers are pushing to delist chinese companies that don't comply with u.s. accounting standards. the administration has also pressured a federal retirement plan to avoid buying chinese stocks.

in july, state grid corp. of china, the government-owned group that operates most of china's power grid, sold $1.45 billion of dollar bonds using the reg-s system for the first time. it had previously sold 144a bonds most years since 2013, according to dealogic.

two bankers who worked on the deal said state grid was cognizant of the diplomatic climate, and didn't want to be seen as being subordinate to u.s. rules. other state-backed companies might also be reluctant to issue under 144a rules, one of the bankers said.

overall u.s. participation in asia's bond market has actually risen this year, the bofa data show, driven by increases in indonesia, malaysia and india, while u.s. involvement in chinese, south korean and singaporean deals has fallen.

4,2020-08-19,"the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened attention on race have thrown new light on a longstanding source of economic inequality: black communities have less access to credit than white ones.

to address that gap, washington and wall street are turning to a small network of lenders set up precisely to address that disparity. community development financial institutions, or cdfis, are community-based banks, credit unions and investment funds that lend to home buyers, small businesses and others in rural, impoverished and minority communities.earlier this year, congress and the trump administration earmarked billions of dollars for cdfis to issue paycheck protection program loans to small businesses. meanwhile, cdfis have received multimillion-dollar investments from traditional lenders such as goldman sachs group inc. and bank of america corp., and new corporate supporters such as netflix inc. and google inc.

hope, based in jackson, miss., runs two cdfis, a credit union and nonprofit loan fund, that focus on communities of color in the deep south. at the end of june, it received a $10 million investment from netflix in the form of a two-year certificate of deposit. hope says it will support roughly 2,500 entrepreneurs, home buyers and consumers of color.

there has been more discussion of cdfis and economic opportunity for people of color in the past four months than the previous 40 years, said hope's chief executive, bill bynum: ""it's been a dramatic turn.""the attention netflix's deposit drew""was more valuable than the deposit itself,"" he added, helping draw millions of dollars more in commitments.

google joined with the opportunity finance network, a membership group for cdfis, to launch a $125 million fund for the industry. goldman, bank of america, morgan stanley, citigroup inc. and wells fargo & co., all of which had existing relationships with cdfis, have in recent months announced investments ranging from $5 million to $750 million.

there are about 1,100 cdfis nationwide. under a program created in 1994, the treasury department's cdfi fund certifies cdfis and provides them with grants, low-cost credit and operational support.

fourteen percent of black adults didn't have a bank account in 2019, according to the federal reserve, versus 6% of adults overall. just 23% of black-owned small businesses with employees used bank funding in the past five years, half the level of white-owned firms, a fed report showed.

this helps explain why black-owned firms likely had relatively limited access to the federal $670 billion paycheck protection program, which offered forgivable loans to small businesses to weather the pandemic. several commercial lenders issuing the loans initially prioritized customers with existing relationships.

cdfis are meant to redress such disparities. for example, the opportunity finance network, based on a 2018 survey, estimates 58% of the clients served by its roughly 300 members are people of color, 85% are low-income and 48% are women.

when ppp opened in early april, sunyatta amen, who is black, sought a loan for her washington, d.c., tea and wellness stores. she found her main bank, wells fargo, was initially accepting only statements of interest, not applications. ppp exhausted its first round of funding on april 16, a day after wells fargo invited ms. amen to apply, which she did.

ms. amen said she followed a family friend's recommendation to look into optus bank, a black-owned cdfi in columbia, s.c. after congress replenished ppp, ms. amen applied to optus, which processed her $52,000 ppp loan within days.

""with optus, it was awesome. it was painless and i really salute them. i'm proud that black-owned bank came through for us,"" ms. amen said.

wells fargo later got back to ms. amen, informing her that the small business administration wouldn't guarantee the first ppp loan she applied for because she had already proceeded with optus.

""we wish we could have helped every single small business seeking a ppp loan, and we devoted thousands of employees to this effort,"" a wells fargo spokesman said.

5,2020-08-15,"warren buffett's berkshire hathaway inc. unloaded billions of dollars of bank stocks as the u.s. economy reeled during the coronavirus lockdown.

berkshire's holdings of wells fargo & co. and jpmorgan chase & co. stock dropped by more than $3 billion apiece in the second quarter, according to regulatory filings made public friday. the company also dissolved its stake in goldman sachs group inc., which was worth about $300 million at the end of the first quarter.the conglomerate has simultaneously been adding to its ownership of bank of america corp. in recent weeks and now owns roughly 12% of the company, according to factset.

bank stocks have taken a big hit this year as the largest set aside tens of billions of dollars to account for potential loan losses.

bank executives have said they believe the current recession will now be deeper and longer than initially expected. the kbw nasdaq bank index has fallen 31% this year.

mr. buffett has expressed optimism about a recovery in the u.s. economy, but warned in may that stocks can be unpredictable.

""you can bet on america, but you are going to have to be careful on how you bet. simply because markets can do anything,"" he said.

berkshire's sales amount to a 26% drop in its shareholdings of wells fargo. his jpmorgan stake is down by 62%. he also sold shares of bank of new york mellon corp., m&t bank corp., and pnc financial services group inc., among others.

the sale of wells fargo shares is particularly notable because it means berkshire is no longer the biggest shareholder.

mr. buffett first bought shares in 1989 and stood by wells fargo as its sales-practice scandal unfolded, sometimes receiving criticism for it.

""all the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another,"" mr. buffett said at berkshire's annual meeting in 2018. ""and i see no reason why wells fargo as a company, from both an investor standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes.""

at the end of last year, berkshire's 8.4% ownership stake in wells fargo was worth $18.6 billion, for which the company paid $7 billion, berkshire said in its annual letter.

but the stock has fallen by more than half since then, hit by the economic collapse stemming from the pandemic, the bank's first quarterly loss since the financial crisis and its decision to slash its dividend.

that has reduced berkshire's paper profits -- and the tax bill that would come from any sale.

mr. buffett, however, is betting big on bank of america. berkshire didn't buy shares in the second quarter, but in recent weeks disclosed additional purchases, lifting its holdings of the bank above the 10% threshold mr. buffett has said he typically tops out at.

bank of america shares have risen 9.7% over the last month, but remain down by almost a quarter in 2020.

berkshire first invested in bank of america in 2011, buying $5 billion in preferred shares when the lender was struggling after the financial crisis.

berkshire also received warrants to buy common shares, which it exercised in 2017 to become the bank's largest shareholder.

bank of america ceo brian moynihan said in a recent television interview that mr. buffett first reached out to invest in the bank by dialing its call center and asking to speak with the ceo. the two talk periodically, mr. moynihan said in a recent interview with time.

6,2020-07-17,"bank of america corp. struck an optimistic tone thursday, saying it is seeing early signs of a rebound amid an economy racked by the coronavirus.

jpmorgan chase & co., citigroup inc. and wells fargo & co. played a somber note when they reported earnings earlier this week, warning that they expect the current recession to be worse than initially expected.bank of america ceo brian moynihan emphasized that spending is picking up among his customers. ""as states began to reopen in the past couple months, we saw an improvement in spending levels as customers became more active buying fuel and spending on home projects and eating out,"" he said on a call with analysts.

bank of america said it set aside $5.12 billion in the second quarter to cover losses on its consumer and commercial loans. jpmorgan, citigroup and wells fargo set aside between $7.9 billion and $10.47 billion each.

banks have a unique view into the economy because they handle much of the flow of money that powers it. yet even their executives have struggled to get a clear read on where it is headed at a time when millions of people are unemployed but the federal government is flooding the country with unprecedented stimulus.

while economic numbers have continued to look bleak, the stock market has rebounded to near record levels, leaving many people struggling to understand the dichotomy.

all of the major lenders, bank of america included, are preparing for a wave of loans to go bad, and they made clear they are bracing for a long recession. bank of america's second-quarter profit fell 52%.

the government stimulus measures, as well as the banks' own decisions to let troubled borrowers temporarily skip payments, has helped keep many people afloat. but those measures won't last forever, and it isn't clear that the economy will be back on track when they expire. ""i don't think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us, and it's a rosy path ahead,"" said michael corbat, citigroup's ceo.

the economy has begun to reopen after an abrupt shutdown in the spring. but a resurgence in coronavirus cases is thwarting many reopening plans and could force another closure that strikes a second blow, economists warn.

in states like texas and florida, where virus cases have grown the most and local officials have reversed course on reopening, mr. moynihan said that spending had dropped off a bit, but was still substantially higher than during the initial shutdown. he said that the drop-off in spending from actions like bar closures was outweighed by spending on other goods like home improvement, but that the rebound appeared likely to ebb and flow.

overall, the amounts that bank of america customers have been putting on their credit cards and pulling out of their bank accounts were well below 2019 levels in april and may, the bank said, but about flat in june and higher in early july. to be sure, bank of america still expects deep unemployment and a yearslong rebound from the current period of contraction. the bank said it processed some 1.8 million payment deferrals on consumer debt so far this year, mostly in its credit-card accounts.

the move to sock away money damped bank of america's profit. the charlotte, n.c.-based bank said it earned $3.53 billion, versus the $7.35 billion it made in the second quarter last year. per share, earnings of 37 cents beat the 28 cents that analysts polled by factset had forecast. still, the lender's shares fell 2.7%.

bank of america posted revenue of $22.33 billion, down about 3% from last year. like other banks, the company reported a strong quarter in its wall street businesses. traders have benefited from wild markets, and bankers have benefited from companies rushing to sell stock and debt to shore up their finances.

bank of america's adjusted trading revenue of $4.41 billion was up 35%. the bank posted a 50% jump in fixed-income trading revenue, as well as a roughly 7% rise in equities. total investment banking fees jumped 57% to $2.16 billion, led by an 87% rise in the business that handles equity issuance. its businesses that help companies issue debt and advise on mergers also had strong growth.

7,2020-07-17,"morgan stanley's second-quarter earnings rose 45% as the coronavirus ripped through the u.s. economy and financial markets.

the bank reported revenue of $13.4 billion and profit of $3.2 billion, or $1.96 per share, on thursday. both were quarterly records for the firm and well above the expectations of wall street analysts, who had predicted profit of $1.77 billion, or $1.12 per share.morgan stanley and bank of america corp. were the last of the big u.s. banks to report financial results for a period that posed the biggest test of the financial system since 2008. results shook out along recognizable lines: big commercial and consumer lenders like jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america took provisions for loan losses that dragged down earnings, while a surge in securities trading and underwriting favored wall street-heavier firms such as morgan stanley and goldman sachs group inc.

that flips a script that dictated bank profits for a decade. the long recovery from 2008 favored big main street lenders closely tied to the u.s. consumer, who borrowed and spent heavily during a period of rising employment and steady economic growth. that same calm, sunny outlook sapped markets of the kind of volatility that keeps trading desks busy.

the pandemic brought ""all sorts of massive uncertainty,"" said chief executive james gorman. ""some of that uncertainty, as we just demonstrated, played to our favor.""

morgan stanley's wealth-management brokerage, the country's largest, brought in $4.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter. mr. gorman often calls the unit, which clips fees managing nearly $2.7 trillion of clients' money, a ballast that steadies the firm while its wall street businesses of deals and trades provide the power.

that engine purred in the second quarter. morgan stanley's trading revenue rose 68% from the same period a year ago to $5.6 billion, its highest in a decade. chief financial officer jonathan pruzan said average client balances in the firm's trading arm were 15% lower in the second quarter than in the first and that computer-driven ""quant"" funds, for which morgan stanley is the leading broker on wall street, were slower to return to the market.

the firm's investment bankers generated $1.6 billion in revenue helping companies sell stock and debt to the public, two-thirds higher than a year ago. corporate bond issuance hit a year-to-date record of more than $1 trillion by the end of may, showering fees on bankers who placed that debt with investors. the surge also helped banks in another way, by giving companies the cash to repay bank credit lines they drew on in the early days of the pandemic -- loans banks nervously funded, hoping they would be paid back quickly.

mr. pruzan said the firm had ""consciously avoided consumer credit"" as well as commercial banking, which means it is less exposed to a wave of defaults that looks increasingly likely as much of the u.s. economy remains shut down. its loans to companies and trading clients are mostly highly rated and backed by assets such as real estate and securities portfolios, he said.

the bank's return on equity, a measure of how profitably it invests shareholders' money, rose to 15.7%, above the high end of a target range set last year by mr. gorman. morgan stanley also remains comfortably above a minimum capital level it will have to hit starting this fall.

like other big banks, morgan stanley is temporarily barred from buying back shares or significantly increasing its dividend, which the federal reserve hopes will help preserve cash for banks to weather the downturn. but mr. gorman said he was eager to ""get back on the buyback train"" given the cushion his firm has over minimum requirements.

""we don't want to sit on this capital,"" mr. gorman said. ""we want to put it to work.""

he said morgan stanley remains on track to complete its pending acquisition of etrade financial corp. late this year. the deal, struck just before the pandemic hit and valued at the time at $13 billion, is meant to bring in new clients to the firm's wealth arm, upgrade morgan stanley's technology, and introduce the blue-blooded firm to younger investors.

etrade's crown jewel is a lower-key business: managing the stock that employees at hundreds of companies receive as part of their pay. those shares are typically locked up for a few years and when they become available, morgan stanley aims to move those employees into brokerage accounts. it also has international ambitions for the u.s.-centric etrade.

the deal will also bring some $38 billion in deposits. morgan stanley, which doesn't have branches or traditional bank accounts, has been trying to grow deposits as a low-cost source of funding.

8,2020-07-14,"banks and mortgage lenders are urging the trump administration to scrap a plan to water down an obama-era regulation aimed at combating discrimination in housing, saying it is inappropriate amid the national reckoning on race.

bank of america corp. and quicken loans inc. in recent days came out against the initiative, which would make it harder to pursue housing-discrimination cases by raising the burden of proof needed to bring a claim. lenders were generally supportive of the changes when they were floated last year.""given the recent protests and events, and the recognition of where we are as a country, we would respectfully offer that the time is not right to issue a new rule,"" bank of america vice chairman anne finucane wrote in a june 29 letter seen by the wall street journal and not previously reported.

on monday, the national association of realtors, which had been lukewarm toward the proposal, also urged the department of housing and urban development to scrap it. hud is charged with enforcing the fair housing act, a landmark antidiscrimination law enacted in 1968.

""there is broad consensus across the country that now is not the time to issue a regulation that could hinder further progress toward addressing ongoing systemic racism,"" nar president vince malta wrote to hud secretary ben carson.

and in a separate letter on friday, quicken urged hud to reconsider its proposal, citing a ""rising awareness surrounding issues of racial justice, equity, and inclusion.""

at issue is the so-called disparate-impact rule, which allows plaintiffs to use statistical analysis to demonstrate that lenders and housing providers promote policies that have a disproportionately adverse impact on minorities. as a result, plaintiffs can claim that banks, landlords or other firms violate fair-housing laws without necessarily proving they did so with an intent to discriminate.

the obama administration in 2013 set out guidelines for bringing discrimination cases against mortgage lenders, developers and home insurers. under those guidelines, the defendants must show that they have a reasonable business objective for their policies.

a new plan floated last year would put a bigger burden of proof on the plaintiffs and require them to clear a five-part test to bring a fair-housing case -- including evidence that the allegedly discriminatory practice is ""arbitrary, artificial and unnecessary.""

hud said the modifications would create clearer legal standards in line with a 2015 supreme court decision that upheld the concept of ""disparate impact"" in fair-housing cases.

a hud spokesman, bradley bishop, declined to comment on the plan while it is under review with the white house office of management and budget.

consumer advocates have worried the changes would make it harder to bring discrimination cases.

because few people or organizations admit to racist views or policies, there is rarely a paper trail proving intentional discrimination, which has made disparate impact a key legal tool for civil-rights advocates.

""this is a big flip,"" said mike calhoun, president of the center for responsible lending, which had urged lenders to reconsider their support for the hud plan. ""the industry wanted certainty against legal claims. it's now saying we realize this rule, which clearly gives them that, undermines the broader societal goal of how do we really address these structural barriers.""

9,2020-07-08,"jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america corp. are in line to split between $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion in fees for being the conduits of the government's aid program for small businesses stricken by the coronavirus shutdown, according to an analysis of newly released data.

the nation's two biggest banks by assets delivered more emergency loans than any other lenders that participated in the paycheck protection program, and the two are set to earn the biggest fees as well, according to a review of disclosures made monday by the trump administration.in total, the more than 4,000 lending institutions in the analysis are in line to split $14.3 billion to $24.6 billion in processing fees for ppp loans, according to edwin hu, at new york university school of law's institute for corporate governance & finance, and colleen honigsberg of stanford law school.

the government prioritized speed when it designed the $670 billion program to support hard-hit businesses, betting that banks would be able to get huge sums out faster than a small government agency. but that decision also required giving banks a financial incentive to participate, boosting the program's costs.

running ppp through the banks also resulted in the government inadvertently picking winners and losers in the program's first weeks. banks that already made loans through the small business administration were the first ones authorized to submit applications to the program; most gave priority to existing customers. as more lenders were approved to participate in ppp, small businesses found securing aid easier.

banks have said they don't expect sizable profits from the program -- given the cost of building out loan infrastructure and having to dedicate thousands of workers -- and the biggest banks have said they would donate any profits they do make.

the ppp has delivered more than $520 billion in loans so far meant to soften the economic blow from the virus and related shutdowns. the loans can be forgiven if businesses spend the money on certain expenses like rent or payroll, though businesses have said the process is confusing.

it is common for banks to be compensated for facilitating loans made under government programs. what sets ppp apart is its size: the high end of the range of ppp fees lenders can earn exceeds the total size of the sba's flagship lending program in the 12 months ended sept. 30.

in addition to the program's fees, banks are also set to earn 1% in interest on ppp loans they hold that aren't forgiven, not much more than their cost of funds. the sba guarantees the loans, protecting banks against defaults.

jpmorgan, bank of america and wells fargo & co. are among the banks that have said they would donate whatever profits they make on ppp.

""we will use the net proceeds of fees . . . to support small businesses and the communities and nonprofits we serve,"" a bank of america spokesman said.

the fees banks earn depend on the size of the loans they make: 5% for loans less than $350,000; 3% for loans between $350,000 and $2 million; and 1% for loans north of $2 million.

if the sba later determines a borrower was ineligible for a ppp loan, it can claw back the processing fee from the lender.

more than 30 banks, mostly smaller ones, could earn as much from the ppp loans as they reported in net revenue for all of 2019, according to a separate analysis from s&p global market intelligence.

the government released exact loan sizes only for loans of less than $150,000. the remaining loans were placed within several buckets. ms. honigsberg and mr. hu tallied the exact fees for those loans under $150,000 and the potential range for every other loan.

jpmorgan customers received $29 billion in ppp loans, and the bank stands to get between roughly $800 million and $1.38 billion in fees, according to the analysis.

bank of america customers received $25 billion in loans, and the bank is in line for $770 million to $1.21 billion in fees.

10,2020-06-09,"bank of america corp. has lowered some sales targets imposed on merrill lynch financial advisers who have struggled to grow their businesses, acknowledging the continuing impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on its wealth-management unit.

the bank said it would pare back some of the thresholds affecting advisers' pay that were instituted in 2018 to cajole merrill into growing more aggressively, according to a memo sent to employees monday afternoon and reviewed by the wall street journal.the changes are projected to reduce the number of advisers who see pay cuts by about 1,000, according to a senior merrill lynch executive. the firm employs more than 17,000 advisers.

""we recognize that some practices have been impacted,"" wrote andy sieg, president of merrill lynch wealth management, in the memo. ""in response, we're implementing modifications to limit your downside while preserving the upside.""

under the revised plan, the bank told advisers they need to gain one so-called new household credit by the end of june to avoid a 1% cut from their paychecks, according to the memo. previously, brokers were told they had to gain two new household credits to maintain their pay. household credits are based on the amount of assets those clients commit.

full-year targets for new household credits were also lowered to three from four, according to the memo.

the bank left in place new asset targets that could shave an additional 1% from the payouts of advisers who fail to grow their total assets and liabilities by at least 2.5%. advisers are also eligible for bonuses of as much as 2% if they hit higher household and asset targets.

pay cuts and bonuses are assessed in july for the remainder of the year and are retroactive to january. bank of america will allow advisers to defer their midyear pay cut until the end of december, giving them a chance ""course correct"" and potentially hit full-year targets, the memo added.

11,2020-06-04,"the pandemic led to the genesis of a new class of bonds, paving the way for fund managers to springboard from socially responsible investing to putting money toward the health crisis.

governments, banks, companies and multinational organizations raised $151.5 billion globally by may 31 from selling covid-19 bonds, or debt whose proceeds are broadly earmarked for work linked to the pandemic, according to research by bnp paribas.pfizer inc., bank of america corp. and bank of china are among those that have tapped investors with such bonds since february, though sometimes even the issuers don't classify the debt as virus bonds.

there aren't set rules on what constitutes a covid-19 bond, making it the latest example of investments with broad claims and murky definitions that have drawn large pools of money in recent years. some part of the proceeds from the bonds are being used to fund the development of vaccines or treatments, or to bolster health-care systems and curtail the outbreak. in other cases, the funds may go toward relief efforts, but there is no system in place to track their ultimate use.

the covid-19 bonds are generating more interest than conventional ones for now, said agnes gourc, co-head of sustainable finance at bnp paribas. the french bank has been the bookrunner for 12 coronavirus bond sales so far.

the debt is particularly attractive to investors who are interested in socially responsible investing and who value environmental, social and governance practices. the growth of esg investing in recent years helped the creation of virus-related bonds when the pandemic broke, allowing markets to quickly redirect the flow of capital to the crisis, according to investors and bankers.

""these things don't happen overnight,"" said yo takatsuki, head of esg research and active ownership at axa investment managers. ""covid-19 bonds are a very natural progression and development from a lot of the structures we've been building in the market over the past decade"" for the sustainable-finance industry, he said.

the covid-19 bonds have attracted more money this year than bonds linked to sustainability projects, a corner of the debt market that has received a lot of attention due to growing interest in climate-change issues. sustainability bonds, a broad term encompassing securities that raise capital for environmentally-friendly or for social-impact projects, drew $116.8 billion from investors by the end of may, according to bnp paribas.

the virus bonds should be a financing tool to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic and to address the recovery efforts, said axa. the insurer's asset-management division is asking issuers to be transparent about how the money will be used, and said it isn't taking the label at face value. axa has invested approximately 350 million euros  in coronavirus bonds to date, including those issued by the world bank and the european investment bank.

in common with so-called green bonds, whose proceeds are earmarked for environmental projects, and other esg-related debt, the characteristics of a coronavirus bond can vary depending on the type of issuer or the country. virus bonds issued in china only have to use 10% of the proceeds toward relief efforts, while development banks tend to dedicate all the money, according to bnp paribas.

pfizer raised $1.25 billion by selling 10-year debt in march labeled as sustainability bonds. that debt falls into the category of covid-19 bonds, according to bnp paribas, as the funds are to be used for work to address the pandemic, among other things. but pfizer disagrees with that categorization, underscoring the lack of consensus on what defines a coronavirus bond. the drugmaker said it began exploring the potential for a sustainability bond before the pandemic.

bank of america said the $1 billion it raised from what it labeled a corporate social bond last month would be used to ""support the fight against the covid-19 pandemic"" by lending to the health-care industry. the lender said the bond was the first of its kind from a u.s. commercial bank, and the seventh esg-themed bond since 2013 from bank of america.

in china, more than 200 companies, including manufacturers, airlines and property developers, collectively raised over $74 billion by may 26 from selling more than 700 coronavirus bonds, according to data provider wind info. despite their label, some of the bonds' proceeds are being used to refinance companies' debt, which is helping them avoid defaults.

broad demand for such bonds could in theory result in lower costs for the borrowers, but the market is too nascent for a definite conclusion, ms. gourc said. the coupon on the pfizer bonds was 2.625%, comparing with a coupon of 3.450% for conventional bonds of the same maturity issued in 2019.

more such bonds are likely to come to market, according to ms. gourc, as investors are increasingly interested in allocating their funds to social-impact investing.

""if you have the same issuer having a conventional or covid bond, do you have a preference?"" she said. ""all investors will have a preference for the esg-type bond.""

12,2020-05-26,"shares of economically sensitive companies like manufacturers, energy companies and banks are powering the latest leg of the market rebound.

the industrials and energy sectors logged the biggest gains in the s&p 500 last week, while the financials group also rallied.it was a rare period of outperformance in what has otherwise been a punishing year for cyclical stocks and marked the first time since early january that industrials were the top-performing group.

much of the recent optimism in the stock market has been driven by signs of progress toward a coronavirus vaccine, hopes that have propelled the s&p 500 to its highest level since early march. some traders are betting on effective virus protection by the end of 2020, enabling economic activity to return to prepandemic levels.

bargain hunters last week scooped up shares that have been beaten down during the pandemic. boeing co. surged 15%, halliburton co. rose 18% and bank of america corp. added 5.7%. all are down at least 35% this year.

meanwhile, the rally in big technology stocks that has fueled the market's gains over the past two months slowed. netflix inc., a beneficiary of the lockdown, lost 5.5%.

""it makes sense that people are buying cyclicals on the  optimism,"" said jj kinahan, chief market strategist at td ameritrade. ""but the part that makes me nervous is midmonth in june when most states  . . . i don't know if the reality will be able to keep up with the great expectations that we're seeing right now.""

this week, investors will parse fresh data on april consumer spending and the conference board's index of consumer confidence for may. both economic indicators are expected to fall. they will also review earnings reports from home builder toll brothers inc. and apparel maker ralph lauren corp.

the s&p 500 is now off just 8.5% for the year after rallying 3.2% last week and 32% from its late march low. the industrials, energy and financial sectors of the index all remain down 22% or more for the year.

the coronavirus pandemic has brought the economy to a near halt, forcing more than 38 million americans to seek unemployment benefits as stay-at-home orders have closed businesses and prompted companies to shave their workforces. as a result, consumer spending has plummeted and manufacturing output has slumped. analysts are projecting record declines in gross domestic product in the current quarter.

most analysts agree any meaningful recovery in the stock market will be driven by cyclical shares. but when so much remains unknown about the outlook for the economy, many are questioning the viability of the recent rally. a second wave of coronavirus infections, long-lasting economic fallout from stay-at-home orders and escalating tensions with china could send the economically sensitive shares tumbling, they warn.

any stumbles could propel defensive sectors forward again -- in particular, the health-care, consumer staples and utilities groups that tend to shine in times of turmoil. since the stock market peaked feb. 19, the health-care sector has fallen just 4.3%, making it the best performer of the s&p 500's 11 groups.

analysts say the sector's resilience this year has been twofold. traders initially flocked to the shares in part because spending on health care, like consumer staples or utilities, tends to be more stable, even when americans tighten their budgets.

at the same time, the sector has benefited as investors bet on which biotechnology company will be first to find an effective coronavirus vaccine or treatment. moderna inc. and inovio pharmaceuticals inc. both said last week that their vaccine candidates showed promise in early trials. the stocks have more than tripled this year.

gilead sciences inc. is also working on a drug to fight covid-19 and has seen some success, pushing its shares up 13% in 2020.

the stocks are also popular among institutional investors. global health care remains the most overweight sector among fund managers, according to a may survey conducted by bank of america global research, with managers' net allocation to the sector at an all-time high.

meanwhile, some of the cyclical sectors that tumbled the most during the selloff have subsequently seen the largest gains off this year's low. energy shares have recovered the most since stocks bottomed march 23, jumping 60%.

some analysts and traders, however, caution that some of those gains could be driven by short sellers rushing to cover their bets. energy stocks have been particularly battered this year as fuel demand plunged from stay-at-home orders and an oil-price war between saudi arabia and russia sent supply surging. a recent curtailment in output and signs of an increase in demand for gasoline have pushed oil prices higher and lifted the shares as well. u.s. crude is up by a third over the past two weeks.

despite some signs of a brightening economic picture, liz ann sonders, chief investment strategist at charles schwab & co., said she would like to see a stronger rally among financial stocks to bet the tide has turned.

she and others said it would be difficult to achieve meaningful economic recovery without the group, given how intertwined the sector is with the economy. during the nearly 11-year bull market that followed the financial crisis, financials were the third-best performing group, according to dow jones market data.

despite last week's gains, the group's rebound from the march low is still among the smallest. bank stocks, in particular, have been hit hard by the possibility of a surge in loan losses, as well as declining interest rates. the yield on the 10-year u.s. treasury note settled friday at 0.659%.

""for me, it's hard to envision a scenario where we are truly getting back on our feet economically with financials being  the worst performing sectors,"" ms. sonders said. ""it would be very odd that we see the economy recover and not see some participation by financials.""

13,2020-04-24,"call it a reverse run on the bank.

companies and consumers flooded u.s. banks with a record $1 trillion of deposits in the first quarter, when markets went haywire and america went dark to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.more than half of it went to the four largest banks in america -- jpmorgan chase & co., bank of america corp., wells fargo & co. and citigroup inc. the $590 billion in deposits they gained in the first quarter is nearly double the previous quarterly record of $313 billion for the entire u.s. banking industry, according to federal deposit insurance corp. data.

the biggest bank in america, jpmorgan, took in $273 billion in the first quarter. that is akin to swallowing another top-10 bank, said barclays plc analyst jason goldberg. ""it's taken some of those banks 100 years to get into the top 10,"" he said.

much of the $1 trillion flowed into the banks in a two-week span in march, according to a wall street journal analysis of federal reserve data. during that time, companies were frantically drawing down on their credit lines and stockpiling cash in preparation for a severe recession.

the growth in deposits shows how different this crisis is from the last one. in 2008, america's biggest banks were the bad guys that nearly destroyed the economy. now, they are a refuge for jittery consumers and businesses waiting out the shutdown.

""we believe companies viewed us as a safe haven in this period of stress,"" bank of america chief financial officer paul donofrio said on a conference call with analysts last week.

the fdic had assured companies and businesses that the banking system is a safe place to park money during the crisis, and congress added more protection for bank accounts in its $2 trillion stimulus. the fdic insures accounts up to $250,000, but the new law temporarily expands what types of accounts qualify.

typically, a little over half of all deposits fall into insured accounts, according to fdic data. but the vast majority of deposits in the first quarter flowed into corporate accounts, many of which exceed the fdic cap.

banks' loan books grew sharply in march, largely a result of companies draining their credit lines. commercial loans at bank of america, citigroup, jpmorgan and wells fargo increased by an aggregate $235 billion in the first quarter, more than the industry's median annual gain since 1984, according to the fdic. jpmorgan, bank of america and wells fargo all surpassed $1 trillion in loans for the first time.

the banks also helped the biggest investment-grade companies raise hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate-bond sales.

much of the borrowed funds ended up in deposit accounts at the same banks, executives said last week when the banks reported first-quarter earnings.

citigroup borrowers drew down $32 billion on credit lines in the first quarter. the corresponding rise in deposits accounted for roughly a third of the $92 billion in corporate deposits the bank added in march, said chief financial officer mark mason.

bank of america chief executive brian moynihan said 75% of the $67 billion corporate borrowers drew down on their credit lines ended up in deposit accounts at the bank.

jpmorgan credited its deposit surge to the $55 billion in credit draws its customers made and the $380 billion in investment-grade bonds it helped sell in the quarter.

figuring out what to do with all the new deposits is the problem. because companies have never stockpiled cash quite like this before, banks aren't sure how long the money will stick around.

banks make money on the spread between what they can pay depositors and what they can charge lenders. if the deposits aren't stable, they can't lend them out for fear of getting squeezed.

14,2020-04-24,"j.c. penney co. inc. is in advanced talks for bankruptcy funding with a group of lenders, a sign the troubled retailer is about to succumb to the economic collapse caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

penney is in discussions with existing lenders including wells fargo & co., bank of america corp. and jpmorgan chase & co. for a debtor-in-possession loan that would keep the department-store chain's operations funded during a court-supervised bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter.the loan package could total roughly $800 million to $1 billion, with some of that money potentially including existing debt.

the facility would likely be syndicated so that other lenders could participate, the people said, with one cautioning the amount could change.

a bankruptcy filing could take place within the next few weeks, the people said.

the company entered into a 30-day grace period after missing an interest payment due to bondholders on april 15. it is possible creditors enter into a forbearance agreement if the company needs additional time to iron out negotiations before filing.

along with sears, j.c. penney was one of the dominant department-store chains of the last century. but the 118-year-old company has been losing money for years. with its mall-based stores closed and unlikely to reopen any time soon, the company has been forced to put aside its latest turnaround strategy and face its creditors at the negotiating table.

department stores were struggling before the pandemic forced the closure of most u.s. stores. sears holdings corp. filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and has continued to close stores and sell assets since leaving court protection. macy's inc. plans to close 125 locations over the next three years. kohl's corp.'s sales fell for the most recent fiscal year, which ended feb. 1. neiman marcus group inc. is planning to file for bankruptcy any day, according to people familiar with the matter.

retailers are far from alone in seeing their businesses walloped by the pandemic and the collapse of business activity. energy companies have been pummeled in recent weeks by the combination of a market downturn and plummeting oil prices, leading several to seek restructuring advice or bankruptcy protection.

15,2020-04-16,"for americans checking their retirement accounts, the market's swings during the first quarter were a horror show. for wall street's traders, they were a windfall.

big banks' trading desks posted their strongest results in years during the first three months of 2020 -- when the deepening coronavirus crisis wreaked havoc on the markets -- buying and selling trillions of dollars worth of stocks and bonds, commodities and interest-rate products.goldman sachs group inc.'s debt traders had their best three-month stretch in five years, pulling in nearly $3 billion. bank of america corp.'s stock traders' $1.7 billion in revenue was a quarterly record.

those firms and others had to contend with traders working from backup sites and from makeshift setups at home. the most volatile conditions in years collided with a prohibition on congregating in close quarters like trading floors.

executives also had to balance the opportunity for profits with the safety of staff. jpmorgan chase & co. was slow to act, leading to a coronavirus outbreak on its manhattan stock-trading floor. overall, the four major investment banks that have reported quarterly results so far made $23 billion in trading revenue, 31% more than the same period a year ago.

""march was the most extraordinary month of my career,"" said jim esposito, a 25-year veteran of goldman and co-head of its trading arm. ""we had both a spike in client volumes and spike in volatility. that's a very potent combination that had been missing for quite some time.""

the results were one of the few bright spots in otherwise bleak financial reports. profit fell between 45%, at bank of america, and 89%, at wells fargo & co., after banks set aside billions of dollars to cover expected losses on loans in what is likely to be a painful recession. morgan stanley, slated to release results thursday, will be the last of the major u.s. banks to give a first-quarter update.

the results show how wall street has changed since the financial crisis. today's banks carry smaller inventories of securities than they once did. wary of risk and regulatory snafus, they turn it over more quickly and don't make the same proprietary bets they did before the 2008 crisis.

instead, they mostly stand in between clients who want opposite sides of the same trade. in wall street speak, they ""intermediate risk.""

that spared them from the worst of the declines in asset prices and allowed them to profit by charging small fees on a surging number of trades and lending hedge funds money to finance their own positions.

while banks took huge trading losses in 2008 -- and many were too weak to do much to help clients -- they are in stronger shape today.

""people are desperate to be able to turn their portfolio over and if you don't have to deal with your own issues, you are going to do well."" said paco ybarra, the head of citigroup inc.'s institutional clients group.

the surge is unlikely to last, said octavio marenzi, chief executive of opimas, a consultant to financial-services companies. ""it was easy to make money"" in the first quarter, he said, ""but it was, in all likelihood, a one-time hop. you often see this: lots of trading on the way down, but once you hit the bottom, it's dead quiet.""

goldman's trading revenue rose 28% to $5.16 billion. its algorithmic group, which writes code to automatically buy and sell securities, at one point was on pace to double its 2019 revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. groups that help clients wager and manage volatility in asset prices flourished, too.

coming into the year, goldman had been easing up on the big bets that once drove its trading profit, lowering both the size and riskiness of its securities inventory.

that proved lucky as the pandemic hit, chief financial officer stephen scherr said, leaving the bank freer to jump into the market.

""we came into this crisis with a more manageable risk profile,"" he said. goldman's total assets grew by 10% in the quarter, topping $1 trillion, with much of the additional heft now sitting in its trading operation.

wall street traders have complained for years about calm markets, which depress the volume of trades and make it harder to eke out profits on the ones that do come in. ""volatility wasn't just low,"" mr. esposito said. ""it had pretty much been eliminated.""

that changed in march.

stock prices fell, then surged, and fell again. wall street's ""fear gauge,"" a measure of volatility, surpassed previous records set in 2008. debt investors started getting choosier about bonds, charging far more to lend to lower-rated borrowers than safer ones, after a decade of making little distinction.

those market jumps opened up opportunities for the hedge funds and other asset managers that are clients of big-bank trading operations.

banks ""woke up and all of a sudden these hedge fund clients started whipping it up like butter,"" said bill smead, chief investment officer at smead capital management inc., which counts jpmorgan and bank of america among its largest holdings.

16,2020-04-16,"bank of america corp. said wednesday that profit fell 45% in the first quarter and set aside billions of dollars to cover potentially bad loans during the coronavirus crisis.

the charlotte, n.c.-based bank earned $4.01 billion, down from $7.31 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 40 cents. analysts polled by factset had expected 48 cents.the bank, the second-largest in the u.s. by assets, reported revenue of $22.77 billion, down 1% from $23 billion a year earlier. analysts had predicted $22.71 billion.

the bank set aside an additional $3.6 billion for potential bad loans, a reflection of the darkening economic outlook.

its total provision for credit losses rose to $4.76 billion, from $941 million the previous quarter.

bank of america has a large u.s. customer base that makes it especially sensitive to the state of the u.s. economy, which has nearly ground to a halt as people are forced to stay home and many are out of work.

bank earnings are providing an early look at how the coronavirus crisis is affecting the economy and american corporations. jpmorgan chase & co. and wells fargo & co. reported sharply lower earnings tuesday after socking away billions of additional dollars for potentially bad loans.

already, consumers are struggling to make their debt payments. chief executive brian moynihan said on a call with reporters that nearly a million customers had requested payment deferrals from the bank.

and corporations are drawing down credit lines. the bank's outstanding commercial loans jumped 13% from the fourth quarter to $584.83 billion.

additionally, the federal reserve cut interest rates to near zero last month, limiting the amount of interest banks can charge for loans.

net interest income fell 2% from a year ago.

shares of the bank fell 6.5%.

17,2020-04-03,"hours before small businesses can apply for forgivable loans from the $2 trillion financial relief package, some of the biggest u.s. banks aren't ready to handle an expected flood of applications from potential borrowers.

jpmorgan chase & co. told its small-business customers thursday that it doesn't expect to start accepting loan applications on friday. bank of america corp. plans to limit the loans to customers with existing deposit accounts and loans at the bank as of mid-february, according to people familiar with the matter.under the small business administration's paycheck protection program, part of the stimulus package signed into law last week in response to the covid-19 pandemic, lenders would make available as much as $350 billion in government-guaranteed loans to cover eight weeks of payroll and other expenses. business owners can begin applying on friday for the loans, which are forgivable if businesses keep their workforce largely intact and use the loans for eligible expenses such as rent and utilities.

many details of the program remain unclear, which is complicating efforts by lenders to gear up for what is expected to be an onslaught of prospective borrowers at the end of this week. among what lenders say are the unanswered questions are how much due diligence of borrowers is required and whether they will be able to sell these loans to create liquidity.

jpmorgan said in a statement that it is still awaiting guidance from the sba and treasury department before making loans. a bank of america spokeswoman said the bank could move fastest with its nearly one million small-business borrowing clients.

""we know for these businesses speed is of the essence,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that existing customers are bank of america's ""near-term priority.""

smaller banks also are unsure how to navigate the process. maine community bank in biddeford, maine, has fielded inquiries about the loan program from more than 300 small businesses. chief executive jeanne hulit said the bank, which has about $950 million in assets, doesn't have the information it needs from the government to ramp up lending.

""as a community bank, we want to support all of the small businesses in our communities,"" said ms. hulit. ""but we need to wait for the lender application forms so we know what we have to provide in terms of documentation and procedures,"" she added. ""until we get that guidance from the sba, we are on hold.""

the treasury department and small business administration, which are both working on the new program, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on whether lenders would be required to collect credit memos or other kinds of credit information from borrowers. late thursday, the treasury department provided more instructions to lenders, but final versions of many forms needed to participate in the program weren't immediately available.

megan flynn, co-owner of m flynn jewelry in boston, said she had inquired about the paycheck protection program with two sba-approved lenders, and was gathering documentation she might need to apply, such as payroll statements.

""we're prepared to really fight for it,"" said ms. flynn regarding the loan-application process. she hopes to use the funds to rehire three full-time workers and one part-time employee. ""i don't think anyone is going to make  easy for us,"" she added.

the new program includes a two-page borrower application that asks businesses to provide their average monthly payroll, number of employees and other basic information.

in addition to the borrower application, the sba requires lenders to fill out an application when making a traditional sba-backed loan. as of thursday afternoon, the trump administration hadn't issued a final version of the additional lender application form for the new program. an sba spokeswoman said the agency is revising the form.

a draft copy of the lender application asks for a ""credit memo"" that will support information about payroll, health-insurance costs and other key expenses. it also asks lenders to certify that ""loan proceeds will be used for an eligible purpose.""

18,2020-03-31,"companies ranging from oracle corp. to nike inc. are borrowing record amounts in the investment-grade bond market to build cash before the full impact of the novel coronavirus hits the u.s. economy. much of the new debt is being purchased by an unusual type of buyer: stock investors.

""there is a rotation from a number of nontraditional investors out of other asset classes like high-yield, distressed debt and equities into investment grade,"" said andrew karp, head of investment-grade capital markets at bank of america corp. ""among other reasons, it's a place to hide from volatility.""issuance of investment-grade bonds in the u.s. hit about $73 billion last week, roughly 21% higher than the previous high-water mark reached in 2013, according to data from dealogic.

retail-oriented giants like nike and home depot inc. were among the biggest initial borrowers -- issuing $6 billion and $5 billion, respectively -- but the pace of new deals remains high, with names like technology company oracle and food-services provider sysco corp. joining the fray monday.

nontraditional buyers are accounting for as much as one-quarter of the orders for the new investment-grade bonds bank of america is selling, mr. karp said. the bank arranged nike's deal, among others.

investment-grade bond prices fell sharply in march as some fund managers sold out to meet client redemptions, pushing yields up and making the debt more attractive to buyers like hedge funds that normally focus on stocks. many investors became more willing to buy the bonds after the u.s. federal reserve announced its own plans to start purchasing highly rated corporate debt to bolster the market. bond yields rise when prices fall.

""we generally look at high yield but we've played in some of these deals,"" said david norris, head of u.s. credit for london-based twentyfour asset management. disruptions in the commercial paper market have been forcing blue-chip companies to borrow at unusually high yields although pricing has started to normalize in recent days, presenting fewer options for bargain hunters, he said.

the yield of a bloomberg barclays index of u.s. investment-grade corporate bonds was about 3.7% on friday, down from its recent peak of 4.58% on march 20, but still well above its level of 2.43% at the end of february, according to data from factset. the index declined about 8.5% in march through friday, a relatively steep decline compared with a 15% fall in the much riskier stocks of the s&p 500.

foreign fund managers are also stepping into u.s. corporate bonds because their hedging cost in dollars has declined even as investment-grade bond yields have jumped. bonds issued by banks were among the biggest gainers monday, with wells fargo & co.'s bond due 2051 jumping about 4.2 cents on the dollar to 121.65, according to data from marketaxess.

u.s. government bond yields fell monday despite gains in stocks, showing that investors remain concerned about the virus's long-term economic impact. the 10-year treasury yield declined to 0.667% from 0.744% friday, according to data from tradeweb.

the u.s. dollar rose slightly, in contrast to the u.k. pound and south african rand, after both countries were hit by sovereign credit-rating downgrades.

the wsj dollar index, which measures the u.s. currency against a basket of 16 foreign currencies, was up 0.48% to 93.62 monday, stabilizing after suffering a roughly 4% loss in the previous four trading days.

19,2020-03-30,"banks and financial-technology firms are starting to toughen approval standards for new loans to consumers and small businesses.

large u.s. lenders including jpmorgan chase & co., bank of america corp., capital one financial corp. and santander consumer usa holdings inc. are among the companies reviewing and revising certain lending criteria, according to people familiar with the matter. planned moves include approving fewer consumers with lower credit scores, asking for more income documentation and placing lower spending limits on new credit cards.american express co. has scaled back financing offers to small businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. fintech lenders square inc. and on deck capital inc. said this week they would do the same.

about half a dozen lenders that have found borrowers through fundera inc., an online marketplace for small-business loans, have paused new extensions of credit, said fundera ceo jared hecht. ""lenders have zero idea how to assess risk in this environment,"" mr. hecht said. ""there is no model that can predict today if i lend $1, will i get paid back?""

lenders are concerned that rising unemployment and a potential recession will send loan defaults soaring. the moves suggest at best a pause and at worst an end to six-plus years of a bull run in credit, where financial firms have been eager to lend and underwriting standards for credit cards, auto loans and personal loans have been relatively loose.

lenders are scrutinizing applications for credit cards and personal loans in particular because consumers often turn to them when they are in a bind. they are usually unsecured, which means lenders have little recourse if a borrower defaults, and they can be the first loans people stop paying when money is tight.

many lenders said they would work with existing borrowers who ask for help. some lenders are increasing card spending limits or delaying due dates on loans.

but lenders are reluctant to take on additional risk from new customers.

""even people who applied  in the last two weeks are more vulnerable  than when they applied,"" said brian riley, director of credit advisory services at mercator advisory group.

loan solicitations by email have dropped for credit cards and personal loans, according to market-research firm competiscan. amex, bank of america and jpmorgan have sent almost no card solicitations in more than a week.

the changes could be most painful for low-wage workers such as wait staff and hotel employees uncertain when their next paycheck will arrive. some lenders say they have noticed consumers applying for credit at several financial institutions at around the same time, a sign consumers are reaching for credit lifelines while they can still get them.

to make matters worse, many americans were overstretched before the pandemic, tapping credit cards, auto loans and student loans as costs soared over the past decade but incomes largely failed to keep pace.

lendingclub corp., an online lender that is one of the largest providers of personal loans, said last week it would approve fewer loans from first-time applicants, require more verification of income and employment status, and reduce approval rates to ""higher-risk borrower populations.""

""like many other businesses during this period, we are focused on retaining our best customers,"" the company said in a regulatory filing this month.

small-business lenders also are getting stingier with credit. on deck recently stopped making new loans to movie theaters, hotels and nightclubs. it also made other changes to ""significantly tighten underwriting standards,"" the company said in a regulatory filing last week.

on deck informed ld3 inc., an auto-transport business in berthoud, colo., last week, that its $35,000 line of credit with a 24.9% annual percentage rate had been suspended, said co-owner debbie coyle. ld3 had drawn on that line intermittently since 2017, letting on deck recoup what it was owed from ld3's checking account every week, and had paid off all outstanding balances by early february.

on deck asked ld3 on march 20 to submit three months of bank statements and a screenshot of its business transactions over the previous few weeks if it wanted on deck to consider reopening the credit line, according to emails reviewed by the wall street journal. on deck told ld3 it had chosen to ""mitigate risk exposure"" to businesses that had little or no activity on their credit lines in the previous 30 days.

""the thing that's frustrating to me is the lack of support of small businesses that are hurting right now,"" said ms. coyle, 55 years old. ""the whole point of having a credit line is to be able to use it when you need it.""

ms. coyle hasn't submitted the extra documents to on deck and said ld3 is weighing other options. until the effects of the coronavirus on its business were clearer and the company had a better idea how the federal government would be aiding small businesses, ld3 didn't want to explore additional loans or lenders.

on deck said it placed a ""temporary hold"" on ld3's credit line ""in accordance with our disaster management procedures."" ""by submitting updated financial information, this hold can be removed, and we have discussed this with the customer who indicated they have no need for additional credit at this time,"" it said.

square capital, the lending arm of the payments processor run by jack dorsey, made loan offers to some small-business customers earlier this month but then didn't fund them when customers tried to activate them in recent days.

a square capital spokeswoman said loan offers are expiring sooner in light of more recent data the lender gleans from processing customers' payments.

at amex, many salespeople tasked with calling small businesses to offer cards have been told to stand down, according to people familiar with the matter. the company also has reduced its number of loan offers to small businesses.

20,2020-02-21,"fidelity investments' parent company is spinning out its software startup that gives consumers more control over how their bank-account information is shared with tax, budget and other online financial applications.

fmr llc founded the startup, a wholly owned unit of the firm called akoya, two years ago. but in a bid to help jump-start the use of akoya's platform, fmr sold stakes in the company to a dozen other financial firms. among those new investors are many of the banks fmr hopes will be akoya customers, including jpmorgan chase & co., bank of america corp. and wells fargo & co. financial terms weren't disclosed.akoya expects its platform to go live with customers other than fidelity later this year, the company said. it sits between the financial-services firms that manage consumers' accounts and the many apps that aggregate information to help clients manage their personal finances.

akoya lets customers choose which apps can access data from their bank, mutual-fund and brokerage accounts and how much information those apps can grab. when a customer links a new app to their bank or brokerage account, instead of giving it their username and password they are sent a dashboard that governs access through their financial firm.

customers can later use that dashboard to limit or revoke apps' access to their account data.

the platform aims to put an end to ""screen scraping,"" the process where the app company's software obtains the customer's sign-in information, logs in as that individual and extracts their data. many banks have grown uncomfortable with this approach, in which apps essentially impersonate their customers, said peter wannemacher, principal analyst at forrester research inc.

akoya executives say financial firms will pay for the platform so they don't have to build one themselves or negotiate data-sharing agreements with each of the apps its clients want to use.

""it's a two-sided network,"" said stuart rubinstein, akoya's chief executive.

to be effective, though, akoya needs many participants to plug into its network.

by separating from fmr, akoya seeks to address any discomfort other institutions might have with a platform housed inside a fellow financial-services heavyweight. fidelity has more than 30 million customers and $8.3 trillion in assets under administration. by bringing in many of the biggest banks as investors, akoya believes it has locked up enough users on one side of the network to lure app developers on the other.

""when we envisioned building a utility, we realized we might need to spin it out,"" mr. rubinstein said.

akoya's success will hinge on whether it emerges as a primary network for sharing financial data, mr. wannemacher said. other early-stage startups are pursuing a similar idea, he said, and some banks may offer similar services themselves.

akoya executives said their discussions with banks and other financial firms led them to clearing house payments co., whose network settles trillions of dollars in electronic payments. clearing house, which had been developing its own data-management platform, signed on as an investor along with 11 of its member banks.

in addition to jpmorgan, bank of america and wells fargo, capital one financial corp., citigroup inc., huntington bancshares, keycorp, pnc financial services group inc., td bank na, truist financial corp. and u.s. bancorp have also invested. fmr kept a stake for itself.

mr. rubinstein declined to say how much each bank put into the startup, or what those investments meant for akoya's valuation.

the company hasn't yet started to bring in revenue, and so far only fidelity has plugged into the akoya platform.

based in boston, akoya has fewer than 50 employees.

21,2020-02-15,"investors dumped bonds of kraft heinz co. when fitch ratings and s&p global ratings pushed their ratings of the company into junk territory following disappointing earnings.

a downgrade by two of the three major ratings firms typically forces index operators to classify such companies as below investment grade and prohibit many bond funds from holding their debt.kraft's bond due 2046 fell to about 90 cents on the dollar friday from 96 cents thursday and 101 cents before the earnings. about $4.5 billion of the company's bonds traded in the two days following the disclosure, according to data from marketaxess. that figure represents about 20% of the face amount of bonds outstanding, according to data from bank of america corp.

fitch and s&p pointed to kraft's commitment to keep paying shareholder dividends despite decreased earnings as a risk to bondholders.

""we believe it's important to kraft heinz shareholders to maintain our dividend during this time of transformation,"" said michael mullen, senior vice president of corporate affairs for kraft. ""we also remain committed to reducing leverage over time as we reposition the company for sustainable growth and returns.""

moody's investors service changed the outlook on its kraft rating -- currently at the lowest rung of investment grade -- to ""negative"" from ""stable"" on friday but didn't cut the rating.

the downgrades by fitch and s&p will likely make kraft the largest ""fallen angel"" to enter the junk-bond market since 2005, according to research by bank of america. that change would make kraft bonds account for 1.9% of a widely tracked high-yield bond index, the bank's analysts said.

22,2020-02-08,"bank of america corp. greenlighted a $26.5 million pay package for its top executive in 2019 after the bank's shares marked their best run in years.

brian moynihan is set to receive compensation that matches the preceding year's package. his pay includes a $1.5 million base salary and $25 million worth of restricted stock, the bank said in a regulatory filing friday.his 2019 earnings put him slightly below other wall street chiefs like jpmorgan chase & co.'s james dimon, who made $31.5 million, and morgan stanley's james gorman, who made $27 million.

in 2018, mr. moynihan was the 10th highest-paid among the 75 ceos in the s&p 500 financial sector, according to a wall street journal analysis of pay data from mylogiq llc.

mr. moynihan is now a decade into his tenure as ceo. for years, his pay lagged behind that of rivals as bank of america struggled to rebound from the financial crisis and paid heavy fines to resolve issues from that era. but mr. moynihan eventually refocused the charlotte, n.c.-based bank on its core consumer businesses.

the bank reported net income of $27.4 billion in 2019, down from 2018. when excluding a one-time charge, however, profit rose to a record $29.1 billion.

bank of america's stock jumped more than 40% in 2019, its biggest annual rise since 2012, amid a broader rally in bank stocks. one reason for the move: bank of america returned a record $34 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. in the third quarter of last year, no s&p 500 company besides apple inc. bought back more of its stock, according to s&p dow jones indices.

buybacks can boost stock prices by pulling shares out of the market, making per-share profit look better even in the absence of earnings growth. still, the stock remains more than a third lower than its precrisis peak in 2006.

as in previous years, much of mr. moynihan's stock-based compensation is tied to the bank's performance. to unlock the compensation, the bank must meet certain performance targets over the next few years.

23,2020-02-03,"the booming stock market has meant brisk business for financial advisers. not so at wells fargo & co.

the bank's wealth-management profit has barely budged from 2016, the year its fake-account scandal burst into public view.bank of america corp. and morgan stanley, meanwhile, have posted double-digit gains in their wealth businesses.

the stall has some of wells fargo's more than 13,000 financial advisers heading for the exits. to stem the tide, the bank is luring new advisers with six-figure bonuses while asking for money back from those who don't meet performance goals, according to interviews with current and former wells fargo advisers.

times are generally good for financial advisers, who are in high demand as the stock market rises and a growing population of retirees seeks investment advice. what's more, fee-generating businesses such as wealth management have become more important for banks since low interest rates have crimped lending profits. but wells fargo is finding that it is hard to win back the trust it lost when it came to light that branch employees opened perhaps millions of phony accounts without customer knowledge.

wells fargo executives believe the wealth operation -- one of the bank's three main business lines -- is close to turning around after the scandal. wealth-management head jonathan weiss has put new managers in place, and the bank said 2019 was its best recruiting year since before the scandal erupted. yet expenses have jumped 23% from a year ago, in part because of higher compensation and benefits.

""we are proud that so many outstanding financial advisers are choosing to join us,"" a bank spokeswoman said. ""we remain optimistic about the business and the future.""

the business has a long way to go to make up ground it lost following the scandal. the wealth division managed client assets valued at $1.9 trillion at the end of last year, up 12% from the end of 2016. client assets at bank of america and morgan stanley rose 21% and 28%, respectively.

wells fargo is paying up to replace advisers it has lost in recent years. it is offering candidates a bonus of as much as 200% of their revenue from the prior year, recruiters said, which is around 25 to 50 percentage points higher than what competitors are offering.

the bank is trying to attract advisers with bigger books of business, and it recently changed their pay structure to discourage them from taking on smaller accounts.

wells fargo's damaged reputation makes it a tough sell.

""advisers tell me they don't want to have to apologize for the firm they work for,"" said brian hamburger, chief executive at marketcounsel consulting, a consultancy to financial advisers.

times are especially tough for advisers who work out of wells fargo branches and depend on referrals from bankers, according to current and former advisers. referrals fell after the bank eliminated sales goals in 2016 to stamp out an aggressive sales culture that led to the fake-account openings.

the lender has reintroduced some goals and says referrals from bankers to in-branch advisers are up.

wells fargo's consumer bank referred $2.6 billion of investment assets to the wealth business in the final three months of last year, up 18% from a year earlier, but still down from the $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2016. some in-branch advisers said they are earning less than half of what they did at their former firms, and they are struggling to pay their bills and cutting back on expenses.

24,2020-02-01,"bank of america corp. told a 92-year-old customer it would attempt to recover nearly $40,000 he lost to a phone scam -- but only after the man signed legal papers promising not to discuss the fraud or sue the bank.

the bank couldn't guarantee it would recoup any of the money, but under the terms of the agreement, if the elderly man is asked about the funds he sent scammers or efforts to recover it he must say ""the matter has been resolved,"" according to a copy of the document reviewed by the wall street journal.such agreements help conceal losses to scammers, consumer advocates say, limiting awareness of increasingly sophisticated forms of fraud that many victims already find embarrassing. many of the scams spring from the billions of robocalls in which fraudsters attempt to dupe victims into sending wire transfers or buying retail gift cards.

banks and credit unions in the u.s. submitted nearly 48,000 suspicious activity reports to the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement network relating to suspected fraudulent wire transfers in 2019, more than double the number submitted five years earlier. meanwhile, the number of robocalls of all varieties continues to mushroom, opening the door to more potential financial losses.

""everything seems like a black hole,"" said jim feldman, the bank of america customer's son, who worked to help his father recover the lost assets. ""the only way it seemed feasible to us to get anything was to go through bank of america.""

documents the family received from bank of america stated that the bank wouldn't be able to start the process until the agreement was returned, and said the customer must sign and return the agreement within 10 days or else the inquiry would be closed.

mr. feldman's father signed the agreement and did not speak to the journal.

a bank of america spokesman said the bank immediately takes steps to recover money and support clients as soon as it is notified of a scam. ""in this particular instance we immediately reached out to the bank that had received the funds,"" the spokesman said, adding that the bank has received the funds back and made the customer whole.

""we are always re-evaluating how we communicate with clients to make sure it is as simple and clear as possible and will look at this to evaluate any room for improvement and simplification,"" he said.

victims of scams that have made wire transfers, in particular, fall between gaps in banking and consumer protection regulations, said daniel schlanger, a new york-based consumer-protection lawyer. while banks are liable for some fraudulent credit-card charges, they aren't on the hook for wire transfers consumers themselves have authorized, he said.

""there's no specific legal obligation"" for banks to help fraud victims recover funds they agreed to transfer, said kim phan, a partner at law firm ballard spahr llp.

""in these cases where the customer authorized the transactions, we are acting voluntarily to assist the customer and try to assist them and law enforcement in any way we can,"" the bank of america spokesman said.

some banks ask customers to sign confidentiality agreements, attorneys say, because they don't want consumers who hear about another person's experience to expect that a bank will be successful in every case.

a regions financial corp. agreement, reviewed by the journal, required a scam victim to keep the agreement and the underlying situation confidential. the contract bars the customer, who was reimbursed $2,700 in losses, from cooperating with any organization or testifying unless they are subpoenaed.

""we examine each circumstance individually and any request for a customer to sign an agreement requiring confidentiality in relation to a fraud claim is made on a case-by-case basis,"" a regions spokeswoman said.

in some instances, banks ask customers to agree not to sue them in the future and hold them harmless as they seek to recover money. such agreements are used in part to prevent customers from taking advantage of banks with fake claims, and because banks typically have to indemnify the recipient's financial institution in order to recoup money for their client, legal experts say.

the elderly man's family had warned him not to answer his phone because he might receive scam calls, but the maryland resident did anyway in december. the caller claimed to be with a computer security service and said the company had renewed the man's software subscription and charged his card $39.90.

mr. feldman's father said he didn't have a relationship with that security service and during the course of the call gave the fraudster his bank information so that they could refund him. when he checked the account, the scammer appeared to have deposited $39,920.

the elderly man offered to return the excess money he saw in his account and went to his local bank of america branch to complete the transaction. the teller asked him if he knew the person he was sending the money to. he said he didn't, but trusted the person.

his wire transfer was processed. later that night the man couldn't sleep and realized he had fallen for a scam. the scammer's initial deposit into his account had been canceled. instead of returning an errant deposit, he had transferred nearly $40,000 of his own savings.

the bank of america spokesman said the bank has significantly expanded the resources it dedicates to recovery efforts and has increased its efforts to detect attempted fraud by spotting unusual account activity and alerting clients.

how big banks respond to scams

bank of america corp. immediately takes steps to recover money and support clients as soon as it is notified of a scam, a spokesman said, and typically asks customers to sign confidentiality and indemnification agreements. the spokesman said the bank is always re-evaluating how it communicates with clients.

at jpmorgan chase & co., the bank will investigate and try to resolve customer complaints involving scams without an agreement, but it may require a release if the bank and customer reach a financial settlement, a spokesman said.

a wells fargo & co. spokeswoman said the bank doesn't have customers sign non-disclosure agreements in connection with filing a fraud claim or the bank responding to such a claim. ""we are unable to provide any additional information as we do not publicly discuss our anti-fraud strategies,"" she said.

citigroup inc. doesn't require a non-disclosure agreement when it tries on behalf of a customer to recoup funds the person has sent to another bank, a spokesman said. when the receiving bank asks citi to sign an indemnity agreement to recover the person's funds, citi typically asks its customer to sign a similar contract to retrieve the money.

25,2020-01-18,"shares of wells fargo & co. are back where they started before the bank's sales-practices scandal erupted in 2016, despite the stock's bumpy ride.

that might not seem so bad, but given the timing it is a huge missed opportunity for shareholders.wells fargo shares closed friday at $49.17, slightly below their mark on sept. 8, 2016, when the san francisco bank was first fined for practices that included opening deposit and credit-card accounts without customers' knowledge.

over the same period, shares of big-bank rivals jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america corp. have more than doubled, and citigroup inc. has surged 70%. the s&p has jumped 53% to new highs and its financial sector has risen 56%.

those gains translate into market-value bumps of about $193 billion for jpmorgan, $156 billion for bank of america and $38 billion for citigroup. wells fargo's market value, meanwhile, has declined to $203 billion from $251 billion because of significant share repurchases.

while warren buffett -- the bank's largest and most famous shareholder -- may be patient with his investments, less well-capitalized investors may get antsy.

wells fargo said tuesday that it took a $1.5 billion charge in the fourth quarter to cover related costs, cutting its profit in half. the quarter was the first under new chief executive charles scharf, who has the task of resolving the bank's regulatory problems, fixing its internal culture and restoring its reputation.

on a conference call, mr. scharf called wells fargo a ""wonderful"" bank that had made terrible mistakes and hadn't done enough to correct them. wells fargo's ""road to recovery was always expected to be a rocky one,"" said bmo capital markets analyst james fotheringham. this week, ""management made it clear that it would also be longer.""

26,2020-01-16,"bank of america corp. said fourth-quarter profit fell 4% as the bank struggled to adjust to falling interest rates.

the second-largest u.s. bank by assets said wednesday it earned $6.99 billion in the quarter, down from $7.28 billion a year earlier.the bank had revenue of $22.35 billion, down 1% from $22.68 billion a year earlier. still, that beat the $22.22 billion expected by analysts polled by factset.

the drops in profit and revenue reflect how banks must adjust after enjoying a short-lived period of higher interest rates that boosted lending margins. the federal reserve cut rates three times in 2019, though banks have largely made a smooth transition because of a relatively strong u.s. economy.

""our results continue to reflect the strength of the u.s. consumer in the biggest economy in the world,"" chief executive officer brian moynihan said on a call with analysts.

still, the results contrasted with jpmorgan chase & co. and citigroup inc. both reported big jumps in fourth-quarter profit and revenue on tuesday, boosted in part by strong consumer operations and credit-card spending.

bank of america's consumer bank reported lower profit and revenue. shares fell 1.8% wednesday.

bank of america beat expectations for per-share earnings, though that was partly because it ramped up share repurchases last year, pulling 9% of its stock out of the market. that helped push up fourth-quarter per-share results to 74 cents from 70 cents a year earlier. that was more than the 68 cents analysts predicted.

the charlotte, n.c., lender benefited from the fed's decision to lift rates nine times between late 2015 and late 2018, because the bank has a large u.s. customer base.

it was able to charge borrowers more interest without having to significantly increase payouts to depositors.

net interest income, the amount banks make from lending minus what they pay out on deposits, fell 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.

net interest margin, which measures lending profitability, was 2.35%, down from 2.52% a year earlier.

lower rates have forced banks to increase focus on the fee-generating businesses included in noninterest income. bank of america reported an increase of 0.4% in noninterest income. jpmorgan and citigroup boosted revenue from nonlending operations by more than 20%.

still, lower rates aren't all bad news for banks. they boosted appetite for borrowing across the industry and allowed bank of america and others to lower what they pay on deposits.

mr. moynihan said the bank is also seeing more optimism among its commercial clients as economic uncertainty recedes and the trade war between the u.s. and china cools.

27,2020-01-13,"falling interest rates were a mixed bag for big u.s. banks last year. that should be evident when they report fourth-quarter earnings this week.

the federal reserve cut interest rates three times last year, an about-face after raising rates nine times in the previous three years. lower rates crimp what banks can charge on loans, reducing the profitability on lending operations. but they can also fuel demand for loans and let banks lower what they pay for deposits.jpmorgan chase & co., citigroup inc. and wells fargo & co. report quarterly results tuesday, followed by bank of america corp. and goldman sachs group inc. on wednesday. morgan stanley reports thursday.

banks are closely watched because their results typically reflect the health of the broader u.s. economy, which has slowed in recent months but generally remained strong.

kbw analysts expect big banks to post roughly 6% growth in fourth-quarter earnings compared with the prior year. but they expect earnings to fall about 6% from the third quarter.

net interest income, the amount banks make from lending minus what they pay out on deposits, fell quarter over quarter throughout 2019 after a streak of 15 straight gains. that is unlikely to improve much in the new year with rates expected to stay stable.

that will put a greater focus on the other side of revenue: the fee-generating businesses included in noninterest income. that revenue has been rising as banks try to expand in areas considered more stable than wall street, such as wealth management and consumer lending.

but lower rates have been a boon for consumer businesses such as housing and car loans. lenders made $700 billion in mortgages in the third quarter, boosted by customers rushing to refinance. that was the most for a quarter since before the financial crisis, according to industry-research group inside mortgage finance.

that hot streak is expected to remain largely intact, which should boost banks with big mortgage arms such as wells fargo and jpmorgan.

freddie mac said last week that the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 3.64%, its lowest level in 13 weeks.

the business-lending environment has been less sanguine, as executives fret over a continued trade war between the u.s. and china. many companies, flush with debt after years of cheap borrowing, are opting not to take on more, analysts said. the pace of commercial and industrial loan growth slowed throughout 2019, according to federal reserve data.

quarterly investment-banking revenue should look strong, but that will be partly because of an easy comparison: results were dismal in the fourth quarter of 2018. zooming out from the quarter, trading revenue has been trending down across the industry. banks are cutting costs and competing fiercely for clients, driven by a belief that only a few top shops can be profitable.

in banks' corporate-advisory businesses, results have been mixed.

global equity sales and mergers and acquisitions were down last year, though big-fee megamergers and debt deals rose, according to dealogic.

one factor that has been helping bank earnings over the past couple of years is buybacks.

in the third quarter, bank of america, wells fargo and jpmorgan were among the top four buyers of their own shares in the s&p 500, according to s&p dow jones indices.

all told, s&p 500 financial firms bought back almost $48 billion of shares in the third quarter, the most in data going back to 1998.

buybacks pull part of a company's stock out of the market, so its per-share earnings can improve even if its underlying profit doesn't.

partly because of buybacks, bank stocks had a strong run in 2019. jpmorgan, bank of america and citigroup all rose more than 40%, topping the broader market.

financial stocks are still cheaper than the broader s&p 500, but they are getting more expensive.

the s&p 500 financial sector trades at around 13 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, versus less than 11 times a year earlier.

28,2019-12-26,"when stephen bearce bought 100 bear stearns shares at about $30 each on friday, march 14, 2008, he was betting the investment bank would be taken over and he would turn a quick profit. he was only half right.

jpmorgan chase & co. struck a deal to buy bear stearns that weekend for a small fraction of the price mr. bearce paid. it took until this month for him to break even.eleven years after scooping up bear stearns, jpmorgan's stock value has tripled, hitting an all-time high. it is up about 40% this year, beating the kbw nasdaq bank index. the nation's biggest bank is now worth about $430 billion, more than one-third larger than its closest competitor, bank of america corp.

the gains mean jpmorgan chief executive james dimon's stake crossed $1 billion for the first time -- not counting options and other restricted shares -- and his purchases since the crisis have earned about $150 million.

mr. bearce's gains are far more modest. ""it only took 4209 days but i am finally even!!!"" the virginia financial adviser wrote in an email, referencing the length of time that he has held jpmorgan shares as a result of the deal.

while mr. bearce represents a narrow slice of investors who bought bear stearns shares just before the jpmorgan deal, there is a classic wall street lesson in his lengthy round trip: money is made slowly and lost quickly.

jpmorgan shares plodded along for the better part of a decade but have doubled since 2016 as profits soared and postcrisis regulations loosened. bank of america and citigroup inc. shares remain below their records, as does the kbw index. just this month, the financial sector of the s&p 500 surpassed the record it set in 2006. every other s&p sector had reached that milestone by the middle of 2016.

""the largest banks are in the midst of some of the greatest structural change in their history,"" said mike mayo, a bank analyst at wells fargo & co. ""some banks are hitting all-time highs, but if you were involved in the troubled banks, it's been a slog.""

when the deal closed in may 2008, bear stearns investors got a little more than one-fifth of a jpmorgan share -- worth around $9.35 -- per bear share.  this month, for the first time, 0.21753 of a share of jpmorgan was worth $30, bear stearns's closing price the friday before the deal was announced.

mr. bearce, 50 years old, has a few extra dollars now. he considered selling for tax purposes but decided to keep the position as a memento.

""i tried to catch a falling knife,"" he said. ""i'm going to keep reminding myself how dangerous knives are. let this be a lesson.""

the pain was worse for many others. bear stearns shares lost two-thirds of their value in the month before the deal was struck. longtime ceo james cayne sold his entire stake before the deal closed when the shares were trading at around $10.

what jpmorgan got from bear stearns is a complicated calculation. most bear stearns employees didn't stay, and jpmorgan has paid billions of dollars in mortgage-related settlements tied to bear stearns and washington mutual inc., its other crisis-era deal. mr. dimon has said he wouldn't do the deal again.

still, bear stearns expanded jpmorgan's investment-banking and trading operations, especially those that do business with institutions and hedge funds. there have been other benefits, as well: this year, mr. dimon and his lieutenants moved into the old bear stearns headquarters while jpmorgan tears down its offices across the street to build a 70-floor skyscraper.

some analysts doubt that jpmorgan stock will continue to outpace rivals next year. it is trading at 5% above the average analyst price target of nearly $130, and more analysts have a ""hold"" rating on the shares than a ""buy"" recommendation, according to factset.

kbw analyst brian kleinhanzl recently downgraded the stock.

""we usually classify jpm as a best-in-class stock that investors can own over a long time period, but over the next twelve months we do not expect shares to outperform,"" he wrote. ""we believe the recent move in shares has pulled forward some of next year's gains.""

mr. bearce said he has no plans to sell.

""it will be a story to tell my grandchildren,"" he said.

29,2019-12-18,"washington -- regulators on tuesday said they had found ""shortcomings"" in the resolution plans at six of the largest u.s. banks, while none of the eight major banks they examined had more serious deficiencies.

the federal reserve and federal deposit insurance corp. said the firms, including bank of america corp., citigroup inc. and wells fargo & co. had shortcomings related to their ability to reliably produce data needed to execute orderly wind-downs, also known as living wills, ""in stressed conditions.""the six banks, which also include bank of new york mellon corp., morgan stanley and state street corp., must address the shortcomings by the end of march. they next submit living wills in 2021.

the agencies didn't find shortcomings in the plans from goldman sachs group inc. and jpmorgan chase & co.

wells fargo said it was pleased the fed found no deficiencies with its plan. a bank of new york spokeswoman said the lender ""will work diligently to address the specific areas of feedback identified by the regulators in the required time frame."" spokesmen for bank of america, citi and jpmorgan declined to comment. the other banks didn't respond to requests for comment.

30,2019-12-14,"shares of hanesbrands inc. slumped on worries about a potential slowdown in its champion streetwear brand.

in a research note friday, bank of america analysts cut their rating on the underwear company's stock to underperform from neutral, cautioning that champion sales could slow. the analysts also lowered their price target to $13 a share from $16.the maker of hanes underwear, the wonderbra and l'eggs pantyhose fell 5.1% to $14.40 a share, making it the worst performer in the s&p 500. the index was roughly flat for the session.

the champion brand has been a success story for the winston-salem, n.c., company in the past few years, having been embraced by celebrities including chance the rapper and attracting nearly 6 million followers to its instagram account.

""we think the brand is still popular, but its distribution is relatively saturated in the u.s. and we worry that changing fashion trends could rein in brand momentum,"" bank of america analysts wrote.

hanesbrands has also struggled this year with soft sales in its core innerwear segment, which includes underwear and socks sold in the u.s. that business accounted for $2.4 billion in net sales last year, or 35% of the company's total, filings show. hanesbrands' share price is down 25% from its 2019 high in february.

the stock peaked above $34 in 2015.

a spokesman for hanesbrands didn't respond to a request for comment.

31,2019-11-22,"charles schwab corp. is in talks to buy td ameritrade holding corp. in a deal that would reshape the discount-brokerage market, where millions of individual investors buy and sell stocks.

the companies have held on-and-off talks for months and were close to a deal thursday, though there is still no guarantee they will reach one, people familiar with the matter said. if they do, it would likely value td ameritrade at around its current market value of $26 billion.a merger would cement schwab's role as the dominant player in the industry. the san francisco-based firm is the largest discount broker, while td ameritrade, based in omaha, neb., is no. 2. these firms have traditionally catered to lower-end clients with cheap online offerings, a business model that big wall street brokers like morgan stanley and bank of america corp. are increasingly emulating.

a deal could fortify td ameritrade and schwab at a time when they are under pressure from falling trading commissions and a dwindling pool of fees for managing clients' money. schwab said last month it would make online stock trades free, the latest salvo in a price war that has thinned margins across the industry just as falling interest-rates crimp income brokers earn on client cash. the announcement knocked $13 billion in combined value off the stocks of schwab, td ameritrade and etrade financial corp., the smallest of the three main players.

td ameritrade quickly followed suit in cutting online trading commissions to zero, which the broker acknowledged would lower its quarterly revenue by about 15%. the moves prompted speculation they would spark a new wave of consolidation among electronic brokers. a merger could help defend the companies against the onslaught, affording opportunities to cut costs and improve profitability.

but the merger is likely to receive scrutiny from regulators given the firms' dominant positions in the industry and their direct contact with individual investors. they can point to new challengers such as robinhood markets inc., a startup that has amassed about six million users by offering free stock trades, and an explosion of robo advisers that offer low-cost advice and exchange-traded funds.

td ameritrade and schwab shares surged thursday on news of the potential deal, which was reported by fox business network and cnbc. td ameritrade stock jumped 17% to $48.38 while schwab shares surged 7.3% to $48.03.

once upstarts, the online brokers now command trillions of dollars in client assets from millions of customers attracted by lower fees and individual brokers who have defected from big wall street firms along with their clients' money.

the firms have also been helped by the long bull run in stocks following the financial crisis, which has helped them draw in aging baby boomers and do-it-yourself investors with swelled account balances.

schwab, a pioneer in free online trades, now has some $3.85 trillion in client assets and 12.2 million active brokerage accounts. that dwarfs the client balances held by its wall street rivals including the u.s. retail-brokerage units of bank of america, morgan stanley and ubs group ag.

schwab's reach now stretches beyond its brokerage roots, spanning banking, financial-advisory and custodial services.

earlier this year, it agreed to buy brokerage and wealth-management operations from insurer usaa for $1.8 billion, a move that pushes it further into the coveted business of financial advice. after rallying thursday, schwab's market value stands at about $62 billion.

schwab got its start in 1963 as an investing newsletter before moving into the brokerage business and opening branches that offered client seminars. the discount-brokerage industry grew rapidly after the securities and exchange commission deregulated broker commissions in 1975. that paved the way for upstarts like schwab, unburdened with heavy overhead, to offer clients services for less.

the business boomed in the late 1990s as technology stocks soared and individuals flocked online to buy stocks on their own for a fraction of what traditional brokers had charged them.

td ameritrade was born of a 2005 merger between ameritrade holding corp. and toronto-dominion bank's td waterhouse. the canadian bank still owns a roughly 40% stake in td ameritrade, which says it provides investing and trading services for 11 million client accounts with a total of more than $1 trillion in assets, as well as custodial services for more than 6,000 independent registered investment advisers.

32,2019-11-19,"wall street says the art of buying cheap stocks is making a comeback -- for real this time.

money managers and individual investors this month stepped up buying of shares of banks, manufacturers and other value stocks -- often defined as companies whose shares trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth.the renewed interest has pushed the s&p 500 value index up 11% over the past three months, more than double the increase of its growth counterpart. the spurt of gains has lifted the value index ahead of the s&p 500 growth index for 2019 and put it on pace for its strongest year since 2013.

shares of bank of america corp., citigroup inc., caterpillar inc. and united technologies corp. have been among the biggest beneficiaries, all climbing more than 17% in the past three months.

more investors say the rebound, which started in september and accelerated recently, has the potential to carry on and close the chapter on a decadelong stretch of dismal performance.

this is by no means the first time investors have heralded a bounceback in value investing, only to quickly see the trade fizzle out. value stocks have lagged behind shares of fast-growing companies throughout much of the decadelong bull rally. the s&p 500 value index has risen 142% over the past 10 years versus 230% for large growth companies. .

some investors and analysts argue this time is different.

measures of investment sentiment have improved as fears of a recession have abated, corporate profits are expected to rebound, and trade tensions between the u.s. and china have shown signs of improving.

more important, value stocks are trading at some of their most attractive prices in years, analysts say.

brian belski, chief investment strategist at bmo capital markets, said the valuation gap between value and growth stocks hit an extreme level in mid-2018 and has grown further since then, helping make value stocks appear inexpensive again.

analysts at bank of america add that value stocks are trading at one of their cheapest levels relative to momentum stocks, which investors purchase because they have been rising. the only other times the discount was this steep was in 2003 and 2008, the bank said. value stocks then outpaced momentum stocks by 22 percentage points and 69 points, respectively, over the next 12 months.

financial stocks trade at 12.7 times their expected earnings over the next 12 months, around their five-year average, while industrial stocks trade at 17 times. that is below technology stocks and the broader index, which trade at 20.7 times and 17.7 times, respectively.

""growth has crushed value over the past five years,"" said ronald temple, head of u.s. equities at lazard asset management. ""but we reached a point where the valuation divergence between growth and value got extraordinarily high.""

mr. temple isn't the only one who believes value is due for a comeback.

a recent bank of america survey found more than a third of the 230 fund managers they polled said they expect value stocks to post better returns than growth stocks over the next 12 months. that is an increase of 21% from the october survey and the third-biggest month-over-month swing since 2007, the bank said.

33,2019-11-18,"stocks' latest records are a testament to one thing: investors aren't worried about a recession happening soon.

the dow jones industrial average topped 28000 in the very last minute of friday's trading session, capping off an otherwise quiet week with its first thousand-point milestone since july.much of the stock market's dash higher in recent months has been powered by shares of economically sensitive companies like banks, manufacturers and oil producers. that rally, along with the relative underperformance of traditionally safe sectors like utilities and consumer staples, has suggested that money managers are turning more optimistic about the economic outlook.

morgan stanley, bank of america corp. and blackrock inc. shares have each added at least 5% in november. their gains have far outpaced that of the s&p 500, which has risen 2.7%. other economic bellwethers have also taken off, with caterpillar inc. and boeing co. both up at least 5% for the month.

investors said the gains reflect faith that the u.s. economy, while undoubtedly slowing, isn't about to tip into recession.

data over the past several weeks have largely reassured money managers.

a labor department report at the start of the month showed the economy added 128,000 jobs in october, far more than analysts had expected given a now-concluded nationwide general motors co. strike that cut into manufacturing hiring. retail sales rebounded in october after a surprising decline in september. corporate earnings for the latest quarter have also been better than many analysts had feared.

next week, investors expect to get a look at minutes from the federal reserve's last policy meeting, as well as a gauge of consumer sentiment and manufacturing activity.

""i'm not going to say the economy's going to boom, but it should start to pick up,"" said jay hatfield, chief executive and portfolio manager at infracap, a company that manages exchange-traded funds and hedge funds.

mr. hatfield said his company has been betting that financial stocks, preferred stock and other generally risky investments will perform well, especially if weaker parts of the global economy, like europe and parts of asia, show signs of improvement.

""we think we're still far away from a recession,"" he said.

mr. hatfield isn't alone. fund managers world-wide are holding the lowest level of cash in their portfolios since june 2013, a bank of america survey conducted between nov. 1-7 found. they have also scooped up more shares of banks and european stocks. both groups lagged behind the broader market earlier this year, when fears about u.s.-china trade tensions sent investors out of risky assets.

as investors have grown less fearful of a downturn, one of the most persistent warning signs of a recession in the bond market -- the yield curve -- has also eased. shorter-term bond yields have fallen below longer-term ones, reversing a pattern set earlier in the year that had worried some investors. still, money managers have said that many of their bets could fall apart if the u.s. and china move away from a trade deal.

the two countries reached a tentative truce in october, when china agreed to purchase tens of billions of dollars of u.s. farm products and the u.s. said it would forgo a planned increase in tariffs. but progress since then has appeared to stall. president trump said on nov. 8 that the u.s. hadn't agreed to roll back tariffs as part of an interim deal, contradicting a statement released earlier in the month by china's commerce ministry.

more than a third of fund managers have said the trade war poses the biggest risk to the markets, according to bank of america. but for now, there is no sign that investors are positioned for a sharp contraction.

while prior escalations in trade tensions have sent investors rushing out of cyclical shares, many such sectors are outperforming the s&p 500 for now. the kbw nasdaq bank index, for instance, has logged a 26% gain year-to-date, compared with the s&p 500's 24% rise. the s&p 500 industrials sector is also outperforming the broader market, up 28% so far this year.

in another sign of investor confidence, bond yields have bounced off the multiyear lows they hit earlier in the year.

garvin jabusch, chief investment officer at green alpha advisors, said pullbacks in the market are an opportunity to scoop up relative bargains. that is because, like many other money managers, mr. jabusch -- whose funds include shares of semiconductor companies like lam research corp., qualcomm inc. and applied materials inc. -- said he believes the u.s. economic expansion still has room to run. on trade, ""i think cooler heads will prevail,"" mr. jabusch said. ""i'm still an optimist.""

34,2019-10-24,"the trump administration wants to put fannie mae and freddie mac back into private hands after more than a decade in government control. the path to doing so will likely lead through wall street.

before the two mortgage companies can be privatized, they will likely have to raise billions of dollars from investors, a move that will require big banks to move further into a sticky political issue. financial firms are already laying the early groundwork.executives at bank of america corp., citigroup inc., goldman sachs group inc., jpmorgan chase & co. and morgan stanley in recent months have talked with the treasury department and fannie and freddie's regulator about how a capital raise could work, said people familiar with the matter.

there are no indications the government has begun a formal process for hiring banks, and it could be a hard sell to investors. still, several, including bank of america, citigroup and goldman, have begun preparing internally to win a role in what could be a landmark event, these people said.

what to do with the two companies has divided lawmakers for years. the two were bailed out with taxpayer money in the financial crisis. if they are privatized, shareholders and bankers could reap big financial rewards -- without eliminating the risk that taxpayers could end up footing the bill for another downturn, skeptics say.

the trump administration still needs to answer important questions to clear the way for a capital raise.

for example, the government still has a large ownership interest in the two firms from bailing them out, which could make potential investors reluctant to get involved.

the government must also decide how much capital fannie and freddie need to stand on their own. the federal housing finance agency, which regulates the companies, said last year they would need to have as much as roughly $180 billion combined, but the regulator is deciding whether to propose new capital rules.

the fhfa and treasury in september began allowing fannie and freddie to retain as much as $45 billion of their earnings combined. fannie holds $6.4 billion in capital and freddie holds $4.8 billion, according to fhfa. still, they would need substantially more capital and would likely need to turn to the public markets for it, to stand on their own.

the initial public offering market has also slowed recently even on more typical companies, which could make it harder to raise money. it isn't clear what forms a capital raise for fannie and freddie would take. the biggest ipo in the u.s. this year was uber technologies inc., which raised $8.1 billion, according to dealogic. u.s.-listed ipos raised less than $332 million each on average this year.

treasury secretary steven mnuchin, who once ran goldman's mortgage-trading desk, has long said privatizing fannie and freddie is a priority.

the fhfa put out a notice this month that it is hiring a contractor to advise it on capital markets. that role could potentially include helping select underwriters and advising on what capital structures could look like.

fannie and freddie are essentially the plumbing behind the u.s. mortgage market, buying home loans from lenders and packaging them into securities that are sold to investors.

35,2019-10-17,"a one-time charge dented bank of america corp.'s third-quarter profit, but the bank posted gains in its consumer, wealth and commercial businesses.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c.-based bank, the second largest in the u.s. by assets, was $5.78 billion, compared with $7.17 billion a year ago.per share, earnings were 56 cents. that beat the 54 cents per share expected by analysts polled by factset.

earnings were hit by a $2.1 billion charge related to the coming dissolution of the bank's payment-processing partnership with first data corp.

third-quarter revenue was $22.81 billion, up from $22.72 billion a year ago. that also beat analysts' expectations for $22.58 billion.

profit rose in the bank's consumer, wealth and commercial units, but fell in the division that houses sales and trading.

""the u.s. economy is in solid shape,"" chief executive officer brian moynihan said on a call with analysts.

shares of bank of america closed wednesday up 1.5% at $30.17.

bank of america and other banks benefited from the series of interest-rate increases from the federal reserve that began in late 2015. that is because the lenders were generally able to charge borrowers more interest without having to significantly increase payouts to depositors.

but now the fed is moving in the other direction: it cut rates twice in the third quarter.

that is starting to affect banks across the industry. some lenders like jpmorgan chase & co., which reported third-quarter results earlier in the week, were still able to boost lending profits with the help of factors like loan growth and an influx of cheap deposits.

others such as wells fargo & co. were hard-hit by falling rates.

at bank of america, lower rates weighed on the bank's lending businesses, but loan growth helped counter that. net interest income at the firm rose 1% from a year earlier and held steady from the prior quarter.

net interest margin fell to 2.41% from 2.44% in the prior quarter.

loans were up about 5%, and deposits rose about 4% from a year earlier.

the lender reported an uptick in new consumer checking accounts and wealth-management clients. bank of america is expanding into big cities where it previously didn't have any branches.

trading revenue rose 4%, helped by higher revenue in both fixed income and equities.

third-quarter trading results at other banks have been mixed. trading revenue was up at jpmorgan and goldman sachs group inc., and down slightly at citigroup inc.

fees in the firm's investment bank, which slipped in recent years, rose 27%. the unit has hired more bankers to focus on midsize companies, executives said.

36,2019-10-16,"warren buffett's berkshire hathaway inc. requested permission earlier this month from the federal reserve to increase its stake in bank of america corp. above 10%.

berkshire typically tries not to own more than 10% of a bank to avoid additional fed oversight. but the omaha, neb., conglomerate's holdings grew to slightly more than 10% in july after the bank repurchased shares.the application underscores mr. buffett's positive outlook on bank of america and on the u.s. banking sector more broadly. berkshire held nearly $100 billion in financial-services stocks as of june 30, and six of its 10 topstockholdings were financial companies.

berkshire said in its application that it might be interested in buying more bank of america stock in the future and that it plans to continue being a passive investor in the bank.

""we have appreciated berkshire's ownership for the past seven-plus years,"" bofa spokesman lawrence grayson said.

berkshire, whose application was earlier reported by bloomberg, didn't respond to a request for comment.

also on tuesday, berkshire reported in a securities filing that it sold off a small portion of its bofa shares last week in connection with a previously planned sale of one of its insurance companies.

in 2011, berkshire bought preferred shares in bofa and warrants to buy common stock, shoring up investor sentiment when the bank's health was in doubt. berkshire exercised the warrants in 2017 for a gain of about $13 billion and became bofa's biggest shareholder.

berkshire previously received permission from the fed to own as much as 25% of american express stock and has committed to remain a passive investor in the company.berkshire owned about 18% of american express as of june 30, according to factset.

37,2019-08-15,"investors continued their run on bank stocks, sending shares of some of america's biggest financial institutions sharply lower following the latest sign of trouble ahead for the u.s. economy.

a brief inversion of the yields on 10- and two-year u.s. treasurys early wednesday sent shock waves through the stock market. banks were among the hardest hit, as investors worried whether the inversion suggests a recession is likely.shares of jpmorgan chase & co., morgan stanley, citigroup inc., wells fargo & co., bank of america corp. and goldman sachs group inc. all slid at least 3.3% wednesday, outpacing the broad s&p 500's 2.9% decline. including wednesday's losses, those six banks have shed $136.7 billion in market-capitalization value since the end of july.

wednesday's move in bond yields raised alarms among investors that the u.s. economy, which has been solid most of the year, is faltering. a strong consumer, a robust labor market and low inflation have underpinned the latest stretch of the economic expansion, even as manufacturing activity and other goods producers struggled.

now, there are concerns that leg of support for the economy, and the stock market, are on the verge of potentially floundering. the inversion of 10- and two-year u.s. treasurys has been a reliable indicator of an eventual recession for the past 40 years, and investors are increasingly factoring in the likelihood that banks will struggle in that kind of environment.

""it's a slide into something no one wants to see,"" said mark lindbloom, a portfolio manager at western asset management co., of the inversion. ""the sentiment shifts among consumers are now the unknown. potentially a change there is how you could see a more significant slowdown.""

for banks, the move down in yields lowers interest rates, compressing how much they can earn from lending. even worse, a broader economic slowdown would likely stifle lending activity, as well as other bank services, further hitting their profits.

investors aren't taking any chances, pushing shares of most banks and financial institutions lower wednesday, so much so that four of those six major banks are trading below their book value. in other words, shares are trading at a price that doesn't fully reflect the assets on those banks' balance sheets.

bank of america, goldman sachs, morgan stanley and citigroup all traded below their forward-looking book values. before this month, only citigroup did so. wells fargo and jpmorgan shares remain above their book values. but that could change if shares remain under pressure this month.

the buying is likely to continue as taiwan's insurers can invest as much as about $65 billion in the etfs, hans mikkelsen, bank of america credit strategist, said.

taiwan insurers have invested for years in what are known as formosa bonds issued in the domestic market by foreign corporations and governments. but local regulators began discouraging the practice in 2018 because the bonds are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars, creating a potential currency mismatch for the insurers because they write most of their policies in taiwan dollars.

the insurers adapted by pouring capital into shares of locally managed etfs that became proxy buyers of u.s. bonds. the trend accelerated this year as yields on larger swaths of investment-grade debt in europe and japan dipped into negative territory.

u.s. government bond yields fell monday, with the yield on the 10-year treasury note at 2.043%, compared with 2.048% friday. yields drop as bond prices rise. the wsj dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 other currencies, rose to 90.13, from 90.01 friday.

39,2019-07-18,"u.s. consumers propelled bank of america corp.'s profit in the latest quarter, though the bank warned it could take a hit from any federal reserve rate cuts.

the charlotte, n.c.-based bank, the second-largest in the u.s. by assets, posted a profit of $7.35 billion, an 8% increase from the $6.78 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 74 cents; analysts polled by factset had expected 71 cents a share.second-quarter revenue was $23.08 billion, up from $22.55 billion a year ago.

other lenders, including jpmorgan chase & co. and citigroup inc., posted earnings this week that also showed strong consumer spending and borrowing but some weakness in corporate activity.

bank of america's earnings followed that same pattern: profit was up in consumer banking and wealth management but down in its global banking and markets units that cater to corporate clients.

pnc financial services group inc. and u.s. bancorp, regional banks with big consumer businesses, also reported higher profits on wednesday. goldman sachs group inc., which has a smaller consumer presence, is the only major bank so far to post a second-quarter drop in profit.

brian moynihan, bank of america's chief executive officer, said on a call with analysts that the bank saw solid consumer activity in the quarter but also noticed business confidence slip a bit. certain companies were affected by the continuing trade battles, he said.

higher interest rates have boosted banks' performance since the fed started raising them in late 2015. that is because banks were able to charge borrowers more interest without having to significantly increase payouts to depositors.

now that the fed is signaling it could lower interest rates, that in some ways is good for consumers. card spending and mortgage originations were up at bank of america, as well as at other big banks.

but the prospect of lower rates also clouds the outlook for banks' businesses. jpmorgan on tuesday lowered its expectations for its lending operations. bank of america executives said that lower long-term rates and any fed rate cuts would cut into net interest income growth this year.

bank of america's net interest margin, a key metric of lending profitability, fell to 2.44%, from 2.51% in the prior quarter.

the bank managed to keep a lid on interest-rate increases to customers in the second quarter.

it paid 0.77% on u.s. interest-bearing deposits in the period, compared with 0.73% in the first quarter.

net interest income, or the difference between what a bank makes from loans or investments and the interest paid to depositors, increased 3% from a year earlier but dropped about 1.5% from the prior quarter.

loans at bank of america were up 3% from a year earlier, while deposits rose 5% over that period. expenses were roughly flat.

though stocks are surging, banks have warned that clients should remain cautious about placing big bets.

trading revenue fell about 10% at bank of america, and merger-advisory fees were also lower, following declines across the industry.

the bank's shares rose 0.7% to $29.19 apiece wednesday.

40,2019-07-03,"bank of america corp. last week said it would stop doing business with private prisons. what the bank didn't say is that it had recently agreed to lend $90 million to one of the largest companies in the business through 2024.

bank chiefs today want to do more than make loans to creditworthy borrowers. encouraged by employees, executives are using their trillion-dollar balance sheets to influence corporate behavior. many big shareholders support that approach.activists also have leaned on banks to rebuff certain businesses, sometimes showing up outside of branches and at the homes of chief executives. but cutting ties with entire industries has proved complicated. bank of america's announcement last week followed pledges to stop lending to some fossil-fuel companies and gun manufacturers. but because of pre-existing relationships, the bank is on course to provide credit to some of them for years to come.

""the private sector is attempting to respond to public policy and government needs and demands in the absence of long standing and widely recognized reforms needed in criminal justice and immigration policies,"" the bank said in a statement. ""clients affected by the policy have unique circumstances and there are often long-term relationships involved""

at bank of america's annual meeting in april, activists peppered executives with questions about its loans to private prisons. andrew plepler, the bank's head of environmental, social and governance, said it was reviewing the business.

as the review was taking place, geo group inc., which runs prisons and immigration-detention centers, was looking to tweak a $900 million loan. the revolving-credit line was so large that a group of banks, including bank of america, had come together to make it, according to securities filings. that is a typical practice in commercial lending.

bank of america's esg team vetted and approved the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. the new revolver was finalized on june 12 and the bank agreed to cover a $90 million portion, according to a securities filing and people familiar with the matter. the loan was extended to may 2024 from may 2021.

soon after, reports surfaced of unsafe and unhealthy conditions at immigration facilities holding migrant children.

on june 24, sleeping giants, an activist group that uses social media to target companies and industries that it opposes, told supporters to email clayton rose, a bank of america director and president of bowdoin college.

two days after the email campaign to mr. rose began, bank of america vice chairman anne finucane told bloomberg news that the bank had ""decided to exit the relationship"" with companies running private prisons and immigration-detention centers. she said the bank would leave the sector as soon as possible after fulfilling its contractual obligations.

geo group said the announcement wouldn't affect its recently renewed revolver.

the june deal means bank of america could be tied to the private-prison business for an additional five years. other companies in the industry also depend on the bank for financing, according to regulatory filings. last year, bank of america covered $140 million of a $1 billion loan to corecivic inc. that expires in april 2023. the bank also extended $65 million of a $455 million loan to caliburn international corp.

corecivic ceo damon hininger said his company has had a relationship with bank of america for about 20 years. meetings with the lender became more frequent over the past two years and the company gave bankers a tour of a center holding immigrant families in dilley, texas, he said.

""up until last week, we were getting a lot of positive feedback from them."" he said. ""it's clearly about politics.""

corecivic and geo group run facilities for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement but say they don't operate border-patrol holding facilities or centers for unaccompanied minors.

41,2019-07-01,"banks are bracing for a third-straight quarter of declines in the business of dealing stocks, bonds and currencies.

three of the biggest u.s. banks -- bank of america corp., citigroup inc. and jpmorgan chase & co. -- have said in recent weeks that trading revenue was on track to fall roughly 5% in the second quarter from a year earlier.stocks in 2019 have rebounded from a december swoon on hopes of continued low interest rates, which benefit the economy -- a rally that could in theory help trading desks. but banks say their clients have lingering doubts about the resiliency of the market and aren't putting on the complex bets that earn bank traders the biggest fees.

""we certainly saw a slowdown in the first quarter coming out of december, where there was low volatility again, heightened uncertainty,"" said mark mason, citigroup's chief financial officer. ""that slowdown has persisted.""

bankers said political issues such as the u.s.'s trade disputes with china and mexico have spooked clients. conditions could improve in the second half if tensions abate and global economic growth isn't affected for an extended period of time. yet, analysts expect trading desks to continue to struggle unless corporate and investor spirits are revived.

""it's hard not to see risk skewed to the downside at the moment,"" wrote susan roth katzke, a credit suisse groupag analyst, in a june note. ""the macro backdrop, ceo confidence, and investor conviction are critical.""

trading remains a vital source of revenue for banks despite regulatory changes designed to make them less reliant on market bets.

the tough trading environment clouds the outlook for banks heading into the second half of the year. for years, slow-and-steady interest-rate increases allowed banks to charge more for loans while keeping deposit costs in check. investors are worried that the federal reserve's decision to hold rates steady will crimp banks' profits.

the kbwnasdaq bank index is up 14.2% so far this year while the s&p 500 has risen 17.4%. banks will begin reporting second-quarter earnings in mid-july.

in response to the tough market, banks say they remain focused on a long-term overhaul of the trading business through investments in technology and new markets, particularly china. the hope is to make the trading business less exposed to quarterly volatility and more about serving clients' data and advisory needs.

banks have been investing in their web-based platforms for selling data and other services to investors.

brian moynihan, bank of america's chief executive, said his bank was spending $1 billion a year to help fixed-income trading desks stay ahead of upstart competitors.

""you're fighting the electronification taking revenue down. at the same time you are taking out costs,"" he said. trading desks ""are making as much money each year, even if the revenue shifts around.""

42,2019-06-03,"small businesses are increasingly battling costly cyberattacks. sometimes the pain is enough to put them out of business.

in january, cyber thieves ran roughly 100,000 stolen card numbers through the payment system of innovative higher ed consulting inc., a two-person startup in new york. soon after, bank of america merchant services, the startup's payment processor, sent a $27,000 bill for reversing the charges.""we had alerted the bank that there was fraudulent activity,"" said ihec co-founder jessie daniels, a sociology professor who started the company as a sideline. ""instead of saying, 'thank you,' they came after us."" the fledgling company had just $1,200 in revenue when it closed in may because of the cyberattack, she said.

bank of america merchant services, a joint venture between bank of america corp. and first data corp., said the company doesn't discuss individual customers. a spokeswoman said the payment processor didn't experience a data breach and its systems weren't hacked.

it is up to business owners to activate security features that can prevent or limit such attacks, said a cybersecurity executive with bank of america merchant services, speaking generally.

""cars come with seat belts. they save lives. it's up to you to click that in,"" said the executive, larry brennan.

ms. daniels and polly thistlethwaite, a university librarian, launched ihec in mid-2018 to teach academics how to get more attention for their research. they opened a business checking account at their bank of america branch in the summer and soon after added a bank of america merchant services payeezy payment account, which lets firms accept card payments online.

in september, bank of america merchant services sent ms. thistlethwaite an email with the subject line: ""have you activated your free fraud protection tools yet?"" the email mentioned optional tools and filters, such as requiring customers to enter the security code on a card. ""you must manually turn on and configure these features if you choose to use them,"" it said.

ihec's owners say they didn't turn on the security features because the payment system wasn't yet linked to the company's website, which was still under construction. in december, they processed their first transaction -- for $200 -- sending a private link to the customer via email.

on jan. 23, the ihec owners said, fraudsters began running stolen card numbers through their payeezy account, racking up $1 charges -- a common tactic to test if the card numbers are still valid. ms. thistlethwaite said she received a phone message from bank of america merchant services on jan. 28, five days after the charges began, that said in part, ""i have some information that i need to share with you.""

on jan. 29, ms. daniels discovered ihec's bank balance had jumped to more than $4,700 from about $1,200. that same day, strangers began calling ms. thistlethwaite, whose phone number was connected to the account, about questionable $1 charges.

over the next several days, as they tried to halt the transactions, ihec's owners visited their local bank of america branch and had contact with payeezy and bank of america merchant services, according to a timeline the pair put together. during one call, a payeezy employee said the problem was caused by a fraudulent payeezy payment page with a hacked script embedded in it, according to notes taken by ms. thistlethwaite.

first data didn't respond to requests for comment. a bank of america spokesman referred questions to bank of america merchant services.

the $1 charges piled up even as the pair turned on security features, restricted access to the account and deleted payeezy payment pages, as they say they were instructed by payeezy representatives.

""i told them repeatedly to shut the account,"" ms. thistlethwaite said. ihec's owners say the fraudulent activity finally ended feb. 1, though they aren't sure why. by then, nearly 4,000 questionable charges had gone through.

larry ponemon, a data-security researcher, said banks should include basic cybersecurity protections, such as two-factor authentication, as a standard feature of the payment systems sold to small companies. ""but they sometimes don't do it because, from a profitability standpoint, there's no incentive to do so,"" mr. ponemon said. those safeguards are important, he said, because small-business owners often don't realize they are vulnerable.

when small businesses ""set up their storefront, they have the same requirements as a big store"" to make sure they are meeting all security requirements, said mr. brennan, the bank of america merchant services executive.

the payment company allows businesses to set security filters and alerts that flag fraudulent activity at levels that best suit their needs, he added. ""we don't want very high velocity filters because if we do that we would minimize the amount of commerce a business can do,"" mr. brennan said.

ihec's agreement with bank of america merchant services includes a $25 fee for each chargeback. in march, bank of america merchant services sent ihec a collection notice for nearly $27,000. ""the chargebacks keep rolling in,"" said ms. thistlethwaite. ""i can't bear to look at the costs. they are just in a stack on my dresser.""

ms. daniels recently started a new company, public scholars llc. ""i'll mostly be doing this,"" she said, ""as polly's enthusiasm for small business has hit her limit.""

for small firms,

a growing problem

as larger companies harden their cyber defenses, small businesses are facing more attacks. sixty-seven percent of small- and medium-size businesses reported they had experienced a cyberattack in the past 12 months, up from 55% in 2016, according to a 2018 survey of roughly 1,000 firms by the ponemon institute, a data-security research and consulting firm.

even the smallest companies can be vulnerable. ""it's not unusual to hear that a small business in the formative stage has a relatively significant exposure,"" said larry ponemon, the institute's founder and chairman. ""we have seen this time and time again.""

some hacks target small businesses and startups for financial gain or intellectual property theft, while others use small firms as steppingstones to attack bigger companies, said chandra mcmahon, verizon communications inc.'s chief information security officer. small businesses accounted for 43% of the 2,013 confirmed data breaches verizon analyzed in its latest data breach report, issued in may.

43,2019-05-14,"bank stocks slumped on monday after an escalation in u.s.-china trade tensions and a drop in bond yields revived worries over u.s. economic growth.

investors monitor financial shares because bank stocks are perceived to reflect the health of the broader u.s. economy. the renewed fears hit everything from large to small lenders.the kbw nasdaq bank index of large commercial lenders shed 3.6% on monday, its biggest one-day percentage loss since march 22.

the index is 14% below its 52-week high from last august but still well above its december nadir and is up 12% year to date.

shares of goldman sachs group inc ., citigroup inc ., morgan stanley and bank of america corp . all fell 3.5% or more.

jpmorgan chase & co . lost 2.7%. wells fargo 's stock, which declined 1.7%, is now up just 0.5% in 2019.

meanwhile, the kbw nasdaq regional banking index of small banks fell 4.1%.

the decline in regional-bank stocks signaled that investors were worried that tepid global growth and low yields would threaten to crimp profit margins, some analysts said.

although many bank stocks have slid in recent weeks, many are still higher for the year.

shares of citigroup , bank of america and goldman sachs are up 24%, 15% and 17%, respectively, in 2019, outpacing the s&p 500's 12% rise.

a further decline in bank shares could signal that investors' outlook for global growth is dimming, said r.j. grant, director of equity trading at kbw inc .

""bank stocks are generally a way that investors express their view on the health of the economy,"" mr. grant said.

""we've had a pretty big rally this year in those shares, but now that tensions are dialed up, everyone is worried about global growth and how that will affect all banks.""

anxiety over sluggish economic activity has raised worries about demand for bank loans for industries that power the u.s. economy, including the housing and auto markets.

bond yields also fell sharply monday, raising warning signs about global growth.

a drop in bond yields, especially for longer-dated debt, tends to hurt bank stocks because their profit margins often expand when there is a bigger difference between short-term deposit costs and longer-term lending rates.

those longer-term yields often help determine the profitability of products like mortgages.

investors have increased bets in recent weeks that the federal reserve will cut rates this year, which would threaten banks' margins.

the yield on the benchmark 10-year u.s. treasury note, a barometer that influences borrowing costs for consumers, corporations and state and local governments, briefly fell below 2.400% from 2.455% friday.",Document J000000020190514ef5e0002c
44,2019-05-13,"in the lean years following the financial crisis, citigroup inc. made an unintentional bet on the future of banking, and it is starting to pay off.

while bank of america corp. and jpmorgan chase & co. were gobbling up cheap deposits at their thousands of branches around the u.s., citigroup was shrinking its footprint, focusing on a handful of big cities to right itself after its near-collapse.now the bank's executives are convinced that many u.s. consumers are finally ready to leave the branch behind and fully embrace digital banking. citigroup added roughly $1 billion in digital deposits in the first quarter, more than all of last year. about two-thirds of that total came from new customers, and a little more than half came from people who don't live near any of the bank's roughly 700 branches.

in recent months, the bank has reorganized its consumer unit, knocking down walls between banking and cards. it rolled out a new account through its mobile app aimed at credit-card customers. and it is targeting potential customers with mobile-banking offers tied to the rewards they get for cards.

""for the 21st century, we are glad we never got the ballast of an extra 4,000 branches,"" said stephen bird, the bank's chief executive of global consumer banking. ""i'm certain it's going to turn out to be a very fortuitous thing.""

other big banks are ramping up their digital offerings too, but they are doing it alongside their giant branch networks. citigroup is wagering that many of those locations -- more than 4,000 each for jpmorgan and bank of america -- will become burdensome.

still, citigroup has a lot of ground to cover to reach its rivals. jpmorgan and bank of america last year far exceeded citigroup's return on equity, a measure of bank profitability, in consumer banking. banks have had some success attracting savers with high-yield online accounts but still find it difficult to establish traditional banking relationships with customers who don't have access to branches.

a mid-2018 survey by the consulting firm accenture found that 84% of u.s. banking customers still visit branches at least once a year, though less than half of people go weekly or monthly. meanwhile, some 44% of customers said they never use their bank's mobile application.

citigroup's outposts in major cities are among the largest and most profitable bank branches in the u.s., but that hasn't translated into broad deposit growth. its u.s. consumer deposits are flat since the end of 2015, compared with double-digit gains at bank of america, jpmorgan and wells fargo & co.

the company was created in 1998 through the merger of citicorp, a global bank with a strong urban presence, and the insurance company travelers. jpmorgan and bank of america, by contrast, built up their retail networks through a flurry of regional-bank deals.

in 2008, citigroup tried and failed to buy wachovia and considered a bid for washington mutual. those deals would have more than doubled its u.s. branch count. it was beat out by wells fargo and jpmorgan, respectively.

a massive government bailout saved citigroup from collapse during the financial crisis, but the bank was in no position to grow for several years. around 2010, it started opening branches in its core cities and debated expanding even more, according to people familiar with the matter. but cost cuts won the day, and the bank continued to pare its u.s. retail network.

yet, unlike its peers, citigroup had a strong overseas retail network. as it was slimming down in the u.s., it was growing in places including hong kong and singapore, providing a variety of digital banking and card services as well as partnering with social-media platforms such as wechat.

for the past several years, citigroup has been importing lessons learned from asian consumers to its u.s. retail business, which is now focused on six major cities: chicago, los angeles, miami, new york, san francisco and washington, d.c. mr. bird, citigroup's head of consumer banking, was previously the bank's asia-pacific chief. last year, the bank shifted its asian regional-consumer-banking head, anand selva, to the u.s.

citigroup's revamped u.s. retail strategy hinges on wringing more business out of its 28 million credit-card customers, two-thirds of whom don't live in a branch market.

the idea of cross-selling banking services to card customers isn't new. but until last year, u.s. cards and u.s. retail banking at citigroup were housed in separate units.

last year, citigroup changed that structure. the longtime global cards head, jud linville, retired, paving the way for mr. selva to take control of both retail banking and cards in the u.s.

45,2019-05-10,"bank of america corp. is considering dissolving the huge payment-processing joint venture it has with first data corp. and developing its own business to move money between consumers and merchants, according to people familiar with the matter.

like its rivals, bank of america is rushing to meet demand from consumers and businesses for modern money-moving technology, which promises a steady stream of fees with each transfer or swipe.leaving the joint-venture would give the bank more control of its business that focuses on moving money for merchants.

the decade-old partnership has been particularly lucrative for first data. bank of america was still reeling from the financial crisis when it negotiated the deal, allowing first data to extract generous terms.

first data has a majority ownership stake in the joint venture -- bank of america merchant services -- and it accounts for about 10% to 12% of first data's revenue, according to estimates by bernstein analysts.

if the bank ends the partnership, it could still work with first data and other outside firms.

a final decision on the partnership, which expires in june 2020, hasn't been made, said people familiar with the matter. both companies are required to give a year's notice before ending it, according to a securities filing.

banks and financial-technology companies are locked in a fierce competition for the business of connecting merchants and their customers.

payment processors enable gas stations, grocery stores and other merchants to accept debit- and credit-card payments. they help move money from a customer's account to the merchant's, and they often sell the terminals used at registers to accept card payments.

citigroup inc. in march said it was starting a unit to provide merchant-processing services for big clients. jpmorgan chase & co. has its own processing unit, which has struck lucrative partnerships with big merchants including amazon.com inc. since ending its own joint venture with first data in 2008.

first data is the largest company in the merchant-acquisition business in the u.s. when including partnerships with banks. bank of america merchant services, the fourth-largest merchant acquirer, processed about 17.3 billion card transactions in 2018, according to the nilson report. top clients include target corp. and best buy co., people familiar with the matter said.

fiserv inc. earlier this year announced plans to acquire first data in a $22 billion deal.

bank of america in recent years has expanded its unit focused on payments across its business lines. its enterprise payments division, which houses teams working on multibank ventures such as venmo competitor zelle and real-time payments, has in recent months hired dozens of employees, including some from the joint venture, focused on merchant payment-processing, some of the people said.

guy harris, a longtime top executive at u.s. bancorp payment-processor elavon, was brought on to help run the group.

the bank also is putting merchant-services representatives inside branches in an effort to sell existing clients these products, two people said.

""the modern payment system is our foundation for the future,"" bank of america chief executive brian moynihan said in april.

the first data partnership has been fraught with issues for years, people familiar with the matter said.

clients have experienced delays getting money from customers, the people said, and outages have kept merchants from accepting cards for short periods.

clients' complaints have caused concern within bank of america because many of these merchants have other relationships with the bank, one of the people said.

46,2019-04-17,"bank of america corp.'s first-quarter profit rose as a healthy u.s. economy led to a strong performance in its massive consumer business.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c.-based bank, the second-largest in the u.s. by assets, was $7.31 billion, compared with $6.92 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 70 cents. analysts polled by refinitiv had expected 66 cents a share. first-quarter revenue was $23 billion, roughly flat from a year ago, the bank said tuesday.profit rose 25% in the bank's consumer business due to higher interest rates, deposit and loan growth. profit climbed 14% in its wealth-management unit, which added new clients in the quarter. global banking profit rose slightly, though investment-banking revenue fell nearly 7% in the first quarter from a year earlier.

bank of america's first-quarter results tracked with its three other big-bank peers that reported earlier this month: jpmorgan chase & co., wells fargo & co. and citigroup inc., which all posted higher profits in the first quarter.

""it's a good economy,"" bank of america chief financial officer paul donofrio said on a conference call with analysts.

but uncertainty around the outlook for interest rates this year has clouded the outlook for big banks.

three years of rate increases have allowed banks to charge borrowers more without significantly increasing what they pay depositors. that era may be coming to an end. the federal reserve in march opted to keep interest rates steady and indicated it was unlikely to raise them at all this year. investors are increasingly betting that the fed will lower rates by january.

bank of america shares fell more than 2% in morning trading, then recovered to finish the day up 0.1%.

net interest income at the bank rose 5% from a year earlier but fell 1% from the prior quarter. executives said they expect the metric to rise about 3% in 2019, helped by loan and deposit growth.

last week, jpmorgan stood by guidance that net interest income will rise in 2019. wells fargo, which is still dealing with the fallout from its fake-account scandal, lowered its projections for 2019.

in the first quarter, bank of america managed to keep a lid on rate increases to depositors.

loans grew by 1% from a year earlier, while deposits were up 4%. bank of america, like other big banks, felt the effects of quiet markets in the first quarter. trading revenue fell 13%.

part of the changes will go into effect may 1, when the bank increases its minimum wage to $17 an hour, it said tuesday. bank of america increased its minimum wage to $15 two years ago and said its minimum wage has risen over $4 an hour since 2010.the bank had about 204,000 employees at the end of 2018, according to regulatory filings. a spokeswoman declined to say how many employees are paid minimum wage, but said the company expects the increase to affect ""tens of thousands"" of employees in the u.s. in the consumer bank, technology and operations and staff support.

other banks have made efforts on this front. jpmorgan chase & co. has been raising hourly wages for some employees to be between $15 and $18 an hour, chief executive james dimon said in remarks prepared for his hearing in front of congress wednesday. those increases have depended on local living costs, he said.

48,2019-04-09,"merrill lynch financial advisers are about to get some help wooing younger customers.

bank of america corp . is putting hundreds of staffers who specialize in selling digital investing products geared toward younger, less affluent investors in its merrill lynch wealth management offices in major u.s. cities.the 300 employees, known as ""financial solutions advisers,"" represent a small addition to the bank's network of 17,500 financial advisers, but the move is a nod to the changing dynamics of the wealth-management business.

a traditional financial adviser was once the only option for upwardly mobile investors, even if most had to save for decades to qualify for their services. in recent years, robo-advisory firms and other digital investing products have siphoned off younger investors with smaller portfolios. by combining the more holistic approach of the financial advisers with the digital savvy of the financial solutions advisers, bank of america hopes to claw back some of that business.

merrill lynch financial advisers offer investment advice and other services to well-off clients, usually those with more than $250,000 in investible assets. the typical adviser brings in more than $1 million in revenue annually.

their services range from standard investment allocation to more bespoke arrangements, such as lending against art collections. in recent years, merrill lynch financial advisers have been encouraged to pitch clients on checking accounts, mortgages and other banking products.

the fsas, who until now were located only in bank of america branches and call centers, help customers set up digital investment accounts with low or no asset minimums. customers can pick from preselected portfolios or choose investments on their own, similar to the digital offerings of charles schwab corp . and td ameritrade holding corp .

the new arrangement could help traditional financial advisers avoid losing the business of existing clients' young family members who fall below investing minimums, said kirstin hill, strategic-performance executive at merrill lynch wealth management. established financial-advisory clients could opt to open a digital account to test their own stock-picking skills, she said.

financial solutions advisers are often recruited from other branch roles and tend to skew younger and more diverse than financial advisers, said aron levine, who oversees the digital-wealth offerings. that could create a pipeline of new talent to become financial advisers, a business that skews white and male.",Document J000000020190409ef490001x
49,2019-04-09,"federal regulators proposed easing a rule that required big banks to plan annually for their own demise, the latest move by regulators under president trump to loosen controls put in place after the financial crisis.

under a proposal approved by the federal reserve on monday, the largest u.s. banks, including bank of america corp., jpmorgan chase & co. and citigroup inc., would produce full living-will plans every four years rather than every year.while no one rule change thus far has been monumental itself, a recent series of proposals represent a significant step to soften the impact of the dodd-frank law, signed in 2010 to ward off another meltdown.

a law signed by mr. trump in may rolled back restrictions for banks with less than $250 billion in assets, the impetus for a series of regulatory changes.

the fed and other regulators have also proposed simplifying compliance with the volcker rule, a dodd-frank provision that curbed risky trading by banks.

democrats in congress have said deregulation could make the financial system riskier, even as many banks are posting record profits. seven wall street ceos, including jpmorgan's james dimon and goldman sachs group inc.'s david solomon, are scheduled to testify wednesday before a house panel and will likely face questions about their companies' resiliency.

""through regulatory reform efforts, we have fundamentally improved the safety and soundness of our financial system, substantially raised capital and liquidity requirements at our largest institutions and established a credible resolution planning process,"" mr. dimon said in testimony prepared for the hearing.

monday's proposal would allow the biggest u.s. banks to file living wills every four years, rather than annually. every two years, banks would file pared-down versions of the plans, addressing capital and liquidity, core parts of their wind-down strategy and any major shifts in their operations.

""resolution plans are an important part of protecting taxpayers and the economy from the failure of a large bank,"" fed chairman jerome powell said. he added the move was formalizing practices that have developed in recent years and didn't represent changes to ""substantive review standards"" for the nation's largest and most complex banks.

banks' living wills essentially explain how they would wind down their operations. most envision the parent company filing for bankruptcy, selling what can be sold -- typically money-management arms and retail brokerages -- and winding down trading operations over time.

if regulators reject a bank's plan, it can be forced to hold additional capital or limit its growth.

regulators and banks have over the years struggled with the living-will process. regulators at times didn't provide feedback to banks in time to inform their subsequent living-will plans, occasionally delaying submission deadlines.

as recently as 2016, jpmorgan, bank of america, bank of new york mellon corp., state street corp. and wells fargo & co. were forced to resubmit their filings after regulators found shortcomings.

wells fargo was alone among the banks in flunking its resubmission and was sanctioned by regulators. goldman sachs and morgan stanley were dinged by a single regulator each and weren't forced to refile.

resolving those concerns was a heavy lift. bank of america said it spent $250 million on consultants and vendors to address regulators' concerns, and its 2017 plan was accepted. goldman built a ""data lake"" mapping the firm's derivative contracts and vendor relationships to better visualize its counterparty risk.

some banks consolidated legal entities to free up funds that would otherwise be trapped in subsidiaries. others added new ones to wall off risky trading businesses from retail banking.

bank of america created a separate broker-dealer to process trades from its institutional trading clients in 2017. ""why are we doing that?"" chief operating office tom montag said at the time. ""that's resolution planning.""

banks said the changes also reflected the strengthening of their capital and liquidity cushions over the last several years.

""it makes sense for the fed to now reassess the pace of living-will submissions,"" said wayne abernathy, an executive vice president at the american bankers association, citing ""substantial gains in both the resiliency and resolvability of large banking organizations and the broader financial system.""

fed governor lael brainard, an appointee of president obama, was the only fed official to oppose monday's plan, which she said ""may leave the system less safe.""

""we saw clearly in the crisis that the failure of one or more large banking organizations may lead to severe stress in the financial system as fire sales and run dynamics spread contagion,"" ms. brainard said. the proposal will have to be later approved by the federal deposit insurance corp., another federal banking regulator.

smaller banks -- depending on their size and business model -- would also be allowed to submit wind-down plans less frequently. some also could file occasional updates to their living wills, which span thousands of pages, if operations significantly shift.

ms. brainard has also voted against several other major deregulatory changes proposed by the fed, including one making it harder for banks to fail stress-test annual assessments and one easing a big-bank capital rule.

the fed separately approved a proposal to change regulatory requirements for large foreign banks, generally easing stress tests and capital requirements for firms with less than $250 billion in u.s. assets. the move follows a similar proposal for domestic banks issued in october.

depending on their size in the u.s. and globally, as well as other risk factors such as cross-border activity, foreign banks would be required to meet different liquidity requirements at their u.s. holding company.

some would see the liquidity restrictions eased, while others, such as ubs group ag and credit suisse group ag, would get additional restrictions, causing a 0.5% to 4% increase in liquidity requirements in the aggregate, the fed estimated.

""this proposal maintains the substantial resilience built up across the u.s. financial system over the past decade, while at the same time making appropriate adjustments for firms that present less risk,"" mr. powell said.

50,2019-03-15,"hong kong's market regulator banned ubs group ag from the most senior role on initial public offerings for a year, fining the swiss bank and three rivals 786.7 million hong kong dollars  in total for cutting corners on ipos.

on thursday, the securities and futures commission fined ubs hk$375 million for due-diligence failures in its role overseeing the 2009 listing of china forestry holdings co., the 2014 debut of tianhe chemicals group ltd. and another ipo that wasn't specified. china forestry was later liquidated, while tianhe's shares have been suspended from trading since 2015.units of morgan stanley and bank of america corp. were fined hk$224 million and hk$128 million, respectively, for their work on the tianhe ipo. standard chartered plc was fined hk$59.7 million over china forestry.

ubs was suspended from acting as a sponsor, or the lead bank on an ipo, for one year.

sponsors conduct due diligence, shepherd companies through a listing and can be liable for misleading statements in prospectuses. sponsor fees are often small, but banks have a better chance at winning underwriting roles if they become sponsors first.

among other things, the regulator said ubs and standard chartered failed to verify china forestry's forests existed. it also said ubs and the two u.s. banks didn't follow up after an interview at tianhe's offices with a purported representative of its biggest customer, who refused to confirm his identity and stormed out of the meeting, according to documents released by the regulator.

a ubs spokesman said it took note of the findings and was pleased to have resolved these ""legacy issues.""

spokesmen for bank of america and morgan stanley declined to comment, while a standard chartered spokesman didn't return a request to comment.

51,2019-03-12,"london -- there is one certainty in brexit: london's pre-eminent role in global finance has been diminished.

on tuesday, the u.k. parliament is scheduled to vote on a last-ditch effort to strike a deal on the country's exit from the european union. talks were deadlocked monday, but many politicians warned that prime minister theresa may could face another humiliating defeat for her latest plan.some of london's financiers have already voted, spending billions of dollars shifting staff and assets to outposts across europe.

regardless of how brexit plays out, europe's financial system has been fundamentally altered, industry executives and analysts say. ""brexit forced a re-evaluation,"" said michael mainelli, chairman of z/yen, a think tank that ranks financial centers.

hundreds of billions of dollars, as well as hundreds of finance roles, have moved to europe's secondary financial centers, especially frankfurt, paris and dublin. jp morgan chase & co., bank of america corp. and ubs group ag are among those diversifying elsewhere. in january, barclays plc turned a backwater subsidiary in dublin into ireland's largest bank by assets.

""dublin is our headquarters for our european bank now, full stop,"" bank of america vice chairman anne finucane said recently in dublin, citing brexit. ""the bridge has been pulled up on that.""

london lost its first-place position to new york last year, according to z/yen.

banks, insurers and asset managers from around the world had over the past decades concentrated global operations in britain. the u.k.'s membership in the european single market gave london-based finance companies regulatory clearance to sell such products as loans, bonds as well as clear trades for clients across countries in the eu.

that access, coupled with a concentration of capital, made london the prime destination for european companies looking to merge or raise money. with the uncertainty over brexit, a shift has been under way since the u.k. voted to leave the eu in 2016.

the defections are more of a flesh wound for a financial center of london's size and, for now, smaller than some analysts anticipated. the bank of england has put the number of british finance jobs to disappear at 5,000 -- about 1% of london's financial-services sector. still, the overhaul signals leaner times ahead for london, according to executives and analysts.

mrs. may has so far done little to prioritize keeping access for u.k. financial players to the rest of the eu. a 36-page draft proposal on future trade relations with the eu includes three paragraphs on the finance industry, which accounts for around 7% of the british economy.

""i am committed to ensuring the u.k. continues to lead the world in financial services,"" u.k. city minister john glen said. ""we are working closely with the industry to capitalize on the new opportunities that brexit brings, ensuring the sector remains highly competitive and open to new markets, while upholding the highest regulatory standards.""

the u.k. parliament is set to vote tuesday on an agreement to smooth britain's exit from the eu. if the vote fails, the march 29 deadline for britain's departure from the eu could be extended by months.if the measure passes, talks will begin on a trade deal with the eu.

any deal is unlikely to replicate the current access u.k.-based finance companies get to eu markets. during trade talks ""we are terrified we will be sacrificed at the altar to protect farming or fishing,"" said a senior adviser to british-based finance companies.

to maintain the status quo, u.k. regulators could pledge to follow eu finance rules. the bank of england, however, is reluctant to loosen its authority to set banking regulations.

facing uncertainty, london's finance executives triggered backup plans. british bank barclays plc in january got the green light to shift 190 billion euros  in assets out of london to its new eu banking hub in ireland.

insurance companies chubb and american international group inc. moved their european business from london to paris and luxembourg, respectively. u.k.-based columbia threadneedle investments said it was transferring european clients of 20 u.k. funds, valued at 10 billion euros to luxembourg. citigroup inc. is staffing up offices in paris, milan and frankfurt.

""the outcome will be that we will be doing less"" in london, said michael corbat, citigroup's chief executive.

since the 2016 brexit referendum, assets worth gbp 900 billion, or $1.18 trillion, including swaps and derivatives, have been earmarked for transfer by financial-services firms from london to the continent, according to new financial, a u.k.-based think tank. of that money, around $1 trillion or so has been moved by banks, which represents about 10% of u.k.'s banking system.

the shift of capital and people to new european outposts adds to staffing costs and chips away at economies of scale offered by a more centralized london operation.

as a result, hiring has slowed. morgan mckinley, a recruitment company, reported in january a 39% fall in the number of open finance jobs in london compared with a year earlier.

work is drifting to paris, frankfurt and amsterdam. yet none has matched london, which remains first among europe's financial hubs.

""there was no consensus where to go,"" said fiona frick, chief executive of unigestion, a geneva-based asset manager with a staff of 60 in london. ""no one city could offer everything london could offer.""

since the 1980s, london's financial center blossomed under relatively light regulation, a convenient time zone and its position as a launchpad into the eu. major japanese, swiss and u.s. banks set up hubs, centralizing trading desks and capital to benefit from economies of scale.

banks drew lawyers, consultants and clearinghouses. in 2016, about half of all revenue generated by finance companies in the u.k. was from non-british business, according to consulting firm oliver wyman.

brexit blew up that model. the weekend after the 2016 vote, barclays chief executive jes staley recently told investors, the bank had two insights: ""one, we're not going to know the answer to how brexit will be implemented until the very end. boy, did we get that one right. the second thing was we need to prepare for a hard brexit.""

regulators, worried about the u.k. crashing out the eu without a deal, urged lenders to set up shop in europe to service clients there. the european central bank, which is responsible for granting banking licenses in the eurozone, told firms to move people and money, rather than create empty shells.

some eu countries seized the opportunity. france wooed bankers with tax breaks. frankfurt attracted executives with its proximity to the ecb.

eu and u.k. regulators, meanwhile, hammered out agreements to ensure that firms in london and europe would still have regulatory clearances to conduct business even if the u.k. suddenly crashed out of the trade bloc.

all of this preparation for brexit came at a cost. bank of america is spending $300 million to $400 million to prepare for brexit. barclays says brexit will cost it about $260 million. swiss bank ubs group ag is spending more than $100 million. goldman sachs put more than 100 people to work on brexit contingency plans.

britain's exit from the eu prompted a u-turn for bank of america. it had spent years pulling assets out of its dublin subsidiary after the financial crisis and parking them in london at the urging of british regulators. after the brexit vote, the bank shifted more than $50 billion in assets back to dublin, which will house its european banking business and 800 employees.

""it isn't all plus-plus,"" ms. finucane said. ""it means a reduction in the u.k. offices.""

goldman sachs, which spent years after the creation of the euro currency in 1999 unwinding its european trading desks to concentrate them in london, also faced a turnabout. the bank is moving some operations to a new skyscraper in frankfurt this year with room for 700 people.

the army of consultants helping the financial industry prepare for brexit had an unintended consequence. combing through british businesses forced executives to justify their u.k. workforce, accelerating a push to recruit in cheaper locales. poland, for instance, has seen a surge in back-office jobs because of banks looking to save money.

brexit may one day offer a few benefits to london's financial services. for one, the u.k. could relax regulation after it leaves the eu.

u.k. chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond predicted last summer that as much as 15% of eu business routed through london could depart and be replaced with new business from asia, according to a person familiar with the matter.

the british capital remains the largest foreign-exchange center. its clearinghouses -- which guarantee transactions between buyers and sellers of such instruments as commodities and derivatives -- still top european challengers.

lch, the clearinghouse owned by the london stock exchange, processed a record $1 quadrillion interest-rate swaps trades last year.

but with the u.k. out of the eu, the ecb is pressing for oversight of clearinghouses serving the continent. that may, in time, force some business to europe, benefiting germany's deutsche borse's eurex clearinghouse.

despite london's shifting fortunes, many bigwig financiers are reluctant to leave the city's cultural delights.

the plush bars and restaurants frequented by bankers still enjoy a brisk trade. the high-end housing market has fallen but not crashed, as some predicted. for some, leaving london for a smaller city is a hardship.

in frankfurt, some relocation agents were ordered to pick up newly arrived bankers in luxury cars with a chauffeur to make their arrival in the german city of 740,000 people seem more glamorous.

one bank told its frankfurt relocation agency to eliminate congratulatory messages from welcome packages, in recognition of people who didn't want to leave london.

by one measure, it is a relatively small group. about 80% of the brexit-related job openings in frankfurt are local hires, said hubertus vath, managing director of frankfurt main finance. of the rest, 15% are bankers who commute from london; just 5% are those who moved permanently from the u.k.

yet, if the chaotic brexit negotiations continue, that number may rise.

""we're already now making bigger plans on moving different components of our business to the continent or to the u.s.,"" blackrock inc. chief executive laurence fink told cnbc. ""i'm hearing this from every organization.""

52,2019-03-02,"after the national bank of delaware county, a small community bank, bought bank of america corp.'s only branch in an upstate new york town, it didn't take long for things to go south.

people waited in four-hour-long lines at the monticello, n.y., branch and withdrew nearly half of their deposits, moving them to banks with more reliable technology. technical glitches got customers so worked up that managers posted two security guards to protect employees. the community bank, which had been in business for more than a century, eventually sold itself in a fire sale.""the analogy i use is if you bought a cadillac escalade and ripped out all of the expensive parts,"" said leon dixon, a former bank of america manager who worked at the smaller bank following the sale.

big banks have boosted profits in recent years by focusing on the largest u.s. cities, which are densely populated and more affluent. the community banks trying to fill the gaps they leave behind, meanwhile, are struggling.

the 4,600 u.s. banks with $1 billion or less in assets -- small community banks -- today hold 6.6% of all bank assets combined. three decades ago, around the time new laws spurred industry consolidation, they held 31.5%.

over the past 30 years, the number of such banks has declined by more than 11,000, largely through mergers. more than one-third of rural counties now have no locally owned bank.

some of these small banks saw a unique opportunity when bank of america decided to pull out of towns across the u.s. and they snapped up many of the 350 branches it sold between 2012 and 2015. instead, the typical bank lost one-third of the deposits within a year of the announcement of the acquisition, according to a wall street journal analysis. nearly 100 of the purchased branches have since been closed or resold.

technology is causing strains throughout the banking industry, especially among smaller rural banks that are struggling to fund the ballooning tab. consumers expect digital services including depositing checks and sending money to friends, which means they don't necessarily need a local branch nearby. this increasingly means people are choosing a big bank over a small one.

bank of america has spent $20 billion on new technology since 2012. bb&t corp. and suntrust banks inc. in february announced plans to merge in the largest bank tie-up since 2004, citing the need to spend more on technology to compete. in the case of national bank of delaware county, its new customers balked at having fewer locations and less-sophisticated technology.

for a while, the national bank of delaware county -- which at its peak had 12 branches -- was among those left standing. interviews with more than a dozen employees, directors and others close to the lender depict a bank in slow decline for years before staking its future on the bank of america branches.

the national bank of delaware county opened in 1891 in walton, n.y., a town located in the foothills of the catskill mountains, 140 miles from new york city.

some 700 people showed up when, in 1962, it opened an air-conditioned headquarters that a local paper deemed ""the most modern building in the village."" in 1979, after a competitor in nearby oneonta tried to buy it, shareholders who didn't want to lose their hometown lender led a successful revolt.

the bank wasn't publicly traded on an exchange. instead, well-connected locals bought paper stock certificates. the stock, which paid a dividend of more than 5% in mid-2014, was a staple of retirement nest eggs and passed down to children. residents who didn't know the right people had trouble getting their hands on it.

as in other small towns that were once vibrant, decades of economic change altered the fabric of walton. the number of area farms dwindled and manufacturing jobs disappeared. civic leaders tried to keep chain stores off the main street but eventually allowed a mcdonald's and family dollar to open.

the west branch delaware river, which runs through the town, flooded in 1996 and 2006, causing millions of dollars of damage.

the bank's health reflected that of the local economy. it grew to six branches in delaware county and was a flexible lender, though few loans ever went bad. regulators eventually frowned on the ""character loans"" the bank often made based on a client's reputation.

local restaurant owner and real-estate agent wilma hannan remembers branch employees blow-drying wet bills after the 2006 flood and giving out loans to help her and others rebuild.

""it's heartbreaking,"" said keath davis, a longtime walton resident who until 2012 operated the last of what were once four new-car dealerships. now he sells used cars. ""two floods and a recession,"" he said, making a slicing motion across his neck.

eventually, there simply weren't enough people or businesses in delaware county in need of loans. by the end of 2013, only 42% of deposits were lent out, compared with 69% at bank of america.

it was around this time that bank of america called. the charlotte, n.c.-based firm did many deals before the financial crisis to become the biggest bank in the country for a period. while that gave it branches in most major cities, it also collected a smattering of less profitable small-town locations.

bank of america started selling those more remote locations in 2012 as a part of a postcrisis plan to repair its balance sheet. the underperforming branches in adjacent sullivan county had been earmarked for sale for years. they had been acquired in the $48 billion merger with fleet boston financial group inc. in 2004.

some of the small bank's directors were hesitant. the deal would double its branch count and bring it to an area that had economic issues of its own.

sullivan county is closer to new york city and was home to the ""borscht belt"" resorts depicted in the movie ""dirty dancing."" many of its large hotels closed years ago and the main street of its biggest town, monticello, is dotted with empty storefronts. still, it has more residents, tourism and money than delaware county.

ultimately, that swayed the bank's board. its leaders decided they needed to grow to survive.

in 2014, the bank paid more than $1 million for the six branches, adopting the moniker nbdc bank. it had to take out a $12 million loan from another bank to cover the sale and boost capital. the added debt left little margin for error.

bank of america required the community lender to keep the branch employees for a year. at first, staffers were happy. nbdc was less focused on sales, which were tough to come by in such a sleepy market. that optimism quickly shifted. deposits started leaving before the deal closed, something that also happened at many of the other banks that bought branches.

nbdc's name replaced bank of america's on the sullivan county branches in september 2014. the small bank neglected some steps typical when a branch changes hands. it was slow to send customers welcome packets with information about their new bank.

within a few months, the acquired deposits had dwindled by nearly 50% to $71 million. internal reports showed that many customers had left for jpmorgan chase & co.'s two sullivan county branches.

""we were supposed to get $140 million. then we went and closed on the deal and those deposits weren't there,"" said leonard govern, a former nbdc board member who is also a funeral director. ""we were in over our heads.""

the deal's economics didn't work without the expected deposits.

former bank of america employees were paid their old salaries, often tens of thousands of dollars more annually than those in the same jobs at nbdc. the bank also was paying steep interest on the money it borrowed to buy the branches. it became clear the bank was going to have to cut its dividend.

word of the troubles spread among shareholders. the stock price dropped from more than $30 in 2012 to a low of about $12 in mid-2015, according to bank documents.

shareholders aired their frustration at the bank's 2015 annual meeting. jim taggart, now retired from the local power company, was among the attendees. he and his wife accumulated about 4,000 shares since 1988, when her mother worked at the bank. the stock made up about a quarter of their retirement savings. ""it was like a local ibm,"" he said.

his wife, lindy, hand-wrote a letter to the bank's directors. ""we were thrilled to be able to get them,"" mrs. taggart wrote of her family's shares, before suggesting ways the bank could make them appealing again. ""we know times are different.""

the bank stood by its plan. executives ended their presentation to shareholders with an ominous slide: a chart of total u.s. banks over time. ""the disappearance of hometown, community banks is not good for america,"" it read. by the fall, nbdc had hired bankers to find it a buyer.

norwood financial corp.'s wayne bank, a larger lender based in honesdale, pa., was the highest bidder. wayne found a way to succeed in towns like walton. it is small enough to make money on the modest branches. but it is big enough, with $1.2 billion in assets, to pay for some of the technology nbdc couldn't. wayne has its own mobile banking app and customers can access a nationwide network of atms without fees.

walton residents are split on the town's future. some see the loss of the one local bank as yet another step in the slow unraveling of the place. ""walton's dead,"" said mr. taggart, the shareholder.

others see a brighter day ahead if it can continue to attract retirees from new york city drawn to the low cost of living. mayor ed snow, a retired new york police department detective, is trying to get wayne to participate in revitalization projects and is happy about the bank's level of interest so far.

mr. snow keeps his and the city's checking accounts at wayne. but he also hung onto an old bank of america account, using it to send money to his sister in california.

53,2019-03-01,"london -- sherborne investors, the activist firm pushing barclays plc to shrink its investment bank, is financing around half of its multibillion-dollar stake in the british bank with a loan from bank of america corp.

sherborne, headed by edward bramson, wants barclays to focus on consumer banking and has asked barclays' shareholders to appoint mr. bramson to the bank's board at a meeting in may. last week, barclays' board recommended a vote against mr. bramson's appointment, saying it remains confident in the lender's current strategy combining investment banking, credit cards and u.k. retail banking.the fact that sherborne has financed some of its stake, and limited both its upside and downside on the bet, could color attempts to get other investors to support the campaign. analysts say mr. bramson faces a huge challenge to get on the board because his message hasn't gained traction, and some barclays shareholders have already said they would vote against him.

""it would be highly unusual for someone with such a small shareholding to be elected to the board of a company. but even if he knows he's going to get voted down, achieving some degree of support from the shareholder base will give him more currency in terms of his argument,"" said john cronin, a bank analyst at goodbody stockbrokers.

sherborne, in a feb. 8 filing, said it bought part of its stake with a $1.38 billion loan and put and call options from the lender to cap its exposure. these protect against losses if the shares fall below a particular level and limit potential gains. the options expire between october and march 2021. people familiar with the matter said bank of america is the lender and counterparty on the options. the securities filing and the bofa loan were earlier reported by the financial times.

in the u.s. securities filing, which was made because sherborne's stake in the bank has risen above 5% to 5.5%, sherborne said it bought barclays shares because it believes they are undervalued. it said it would continue to discuss barclays' performance, capital structure, financial condition and strategic direction with the bank's board and management, and could make further proposals to the board's composition beyond the effort to elect mr. bramson.

sherborne in march 2018 first disclosed it held a 5.2% stake in barclays through shares and derivatives. sherborne's mr. bramson and stephen welker met last year with barclays officials, but they haven't been able to find common ground in their visions for the bank.

barclays ceo jes staley and his management team, with the board's support, want to improve returns at barclays investment bank by expanding in some areas, and consider it core to its strategy to have diverse operations. mr. bramson in a december letter told investors in a sherborne fund that he believes the unit will keep dragging down the bank's valuation without an overhaul.

last week, barclays reported a better-than-expected performance by the unit in the fourth quarter. barclays and sherborne are scheduled to meet again on march 12, mr. staley said. he said he doesn't see the need for mr. bramson to join the board to share his views.

in its filing, sherborne said it bought 943,949,089 shares in barclays for around $2.54 billion in all, with a bit less than half paid for in cash from its funds and the rest through derivative transactions.

55,2019-02-26,"mother merrill is fading away.

bank of america corp . said it would phase out the name merrill lynch from some businesses. charlotte, n.c.-based bank of america bought that storied wall street firm more than a decade ago.bank of america plans to remove the merrill lynch name from its trading and investment-banking operations, executives said monday. it will also rebrand the bulk of its wealth-management business as simply merrill. those are the key businesses that bank of america acquired in the deal, when merrill lynch sold itself in a fire sale in the heat of the 2008 financial crisis.

the rebranding marks the end of an era. merrill lynch had a long history on wall street. unlike other firms that were bought during the crisis, it managed to live on, in name at least, after the acquisition.

the change also reflects how times have changed at bank of america . the bank was once too embroiled in various postcrisis problems to devote energy to renaming the major businesses it bought. but now it is minting steady, record profits, in part by encouraging its various units to work more closely together.

""we are continuing to unify the company, continuing down the road we started on a decade ago,"" chief executive officer brian moynihan said in an interview.

merrill lynch was founded in 1914 by charles merrill. his friend edmund lynch soon joined him. over the years, the firm grew into an army of brokers across the country, sometimes called the ""thundering herd"" for the bull used in the company's logo, that helped bring investing to the masses. the company also built a formidable investment bank. its corporate culture was dubbed ""mother merrill"" for its maternal attitude toward employees and clients.

in the 2000s, then-ceo stanley o'neal pursued a more performance-driven strategy that put greater emphasis on riskier bets, such as accumulating subprime mortgage assets. eventually, that dalliance caused the company serious problems that led to its sale.

bank of america was a bank with deep roots in the south that had grown rapidly through plain-vanilla businesses such as retail banking and business lending. overnight, the deal made the north carolina bank a huge player in wall street businesses such as investment banking and trading as well as wealth management.

the proposed merger quickly became embroiled in conflict. culture clashes continued after the close, and some merrill lynch veterans chafed at being branded with the bank of america name. early on, bank of america executives announced they would keep the merrill lynch name on certain businesses ""for the longer term."" in 2012, the journal reported that the bank had weighed changing the merrill lynch names but decided against it.

the investment bank, trading operations and units dealing with corporate clients have been known as bank of america merrill lynch , or baml for short. the units working with corporate clients will now go by bank of america . the investment bank and trading businesses will be called bofa securities.

the bulk of the bank's wealth business, from the merrill edge business that caters to retail customers to merrill lynch wealth management with its financial advisers, will fall under the new umbrella name merrill. the trademark bull will remain in its logo. u.s. trust, a 2007 wealth-management acquisition that works with ultrawealthy clients, will now be called bank of america private bank.

the decision to use part of the merrill lynch name in the wealth-management brand was ""obvious,"" mr. moynihan said. ""in the wealth-management business, it's the no. 1 brand there is.""

while the names of the various units are changing only now, the culture of what was once merrill lynch has already transformed under bank of america 's ownership.

mr. moynihan has implemented a bankwide strategy of ""responsible growth,"" which emphasizes stability over swagger and frowns on the sort of risk taking that once made merrill lynch lots of money but also played a major role in its downfall.

what's more, many of the current senior executives in investment banking and trading, for instance, never worked at merrill lynch . tom montag , who oversees those businesses, worked there only briefly before the acquisition after years at goldman sachs group inc .

mr. moynihan has pushed the various units to work together, though that can be a challenge. in the wealth-management unit, the independent-minded financial advisers across the country are increasingly working with the consumer-banking unit. they are now encouraged to pitch clients bank accounts and other consumer products, which has led some to grumble.

that business has helped make bank of america 's customer base higher end. in the third quarter, for instance, 36% of the bank's mortgage portfolio was from the wealth-management business.

mr. moynihan, who became ceo in 2010, is focusing more on branding now after years of toiling to put out fires. the bank introduced a revamped logo and advertising tagline late last year.

bank of america 's 2018 profit of $28.15 billion is the largest in the lender's history. while the corporate tax cut and rising interest rates have helped the bank's earnings, years of cutting expenses and focusing on key products such as primary checking accounts have also played a major role.",Document J000000020190226ef2q0000w
56,2019-02-09,"bank of america corp. chief executive brian moynihan received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million last year, a 15% raise from the $23 million he earned the preceding year, according to a securities filing friday.

mr. moynihan, who has run the bank since 2010, earned a base salary of $1.5 million, unchanged from the prior year. he was awarded $25 million in stock, half of which was performance-restricted stock units, and received no cash bonus, according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission. total compensation for mr. moynihan last year was the largest since he became ceo.in determining mr. moynihan's compensation, the charlotte, n.c., bank said it considered factors including the bank's record full-year earnings of $28.1 billion as well as ""continuous investment in the company's employees, client products and services.""

in the bank's most recent quarter, profit more than tripled to $7.28 billion, or 70 cents a share. a year earlier, profit was hit by a charge related to the u.s. corporate tax overhaul passed in late 2017. excluding that charge, profit for the latest quarter rose 39%.

mr. moynihan, 59 years old, was the seventh-highest-paid banking and finance ceo of the 43 in the s&p 500 in 2017. the median pay for those ceos was $12.1 million, matching median pay for the s&p 500 as a whole, according to a wall street journal analysis of pay data from mylogiq llc.

mr. moynihan's compensation also grew 15% in 2017.

57,2019-02-08,"bb&t corp. struck a deal to buy suntrust banks inc. for $28.2 billion, combining two regional lending powerhouses to create the sixth-largest u.s. retail bank and end a decadelong drought in big bank mergers.

the all-stock deal is the largest u.s. bank merger since the financial crisis ushered in a stricter regulatory regime that kept banks on the sidelines of recent deal-making booms. bank rules have loosened considerably following president trump's 2016 election, leading some to predict a flood of consolidations among smaller banks.the merger of bb&t and suntrust could be the deal that opens the spigot. regional lenders are struggling to compete with big national banks such as jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america corp., which are attracting a greater share of new checking accounts from customers that are drawn to their digital offerings.

deposit growth at many small and midsize banks has faltered, threatening a key source of funding. bb&t's deposits were up 2% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while suntrust's were up 1%.

technology was the main impetus for the deal, executives for bb&t and suntrust said thursday. pooling their resources will allow the companies to develop better digital offerings together than they could on their own, they said, making the combined bank more attractive to potential customers.

""the world is changing and we have to change,"" bb&t chief executive kelly king said in an interview.

mr. king, 70 years old, will be the first ceo of the new firm. suntrust ceo william rogers jr., 61, will serve as president and operating chief of the combined company following the deal and will become ceo after mr. king steps down in 2021. the combined bank, which hasn't been named yet, is to be based in charlotte, n.c., home to bank of america and a large wells fargo & co. hub.

the merger brings together two banks with long histories in the south. winston-salem, n.c.-based bb&t has a quirky culture that encourages employees to keep gratitude journals.

suntrust has deep ties to its home base of atlanta. its name graces the atlanta braves new baseball stadium. from 1925 to 2011, one of its vaults held fellow atlanta resident coca-cola co.'s most prized possession: the secret coke formula.

the deal is likely to lead to branch closures throughout the southeast. bb&t and suntrust, which have more than 3,100 branches all told and about 740 within 2 miles of each other, both have been shuttering locations as customers migrate to digital offerings. suntrust shareholders will get 1.295 bb&t shares for each suntrust share owned, a 7% premium to suntrust shareholders based on wednesday's closing price. suntrust shares rose 10% thursday, while bb&t shares were up about 4%.

it is the largest u.s. bank merger since jpmorgan's 2004 purchase of bank one corp. bank of america corp.'s crisis-era purchase of merrill lynch & co. was worth more when it was announced, but its value plummeted before the deal closed.

bank deals of the scope seen before and during the financial crisis have disappeared and are unlikely to return soon. the largest national banks are effectively barred from merging because of their size, leaving potential deal-making to small and regional lenders.

smaller banks have been the biggest beneficiaries of bipartisan legislation to ease banking rules and a lighter touch from regulators under mr. trump's administration.

the federal reserve announced late last year a big rollback of bank rules for regional banks, loosening capital and liquidity requirements for lenders with assets in the $250 billion to $700 billion range.

some 129 u.s. banks had assets in the $10 billion to $250 billion range in the third quarter of 2018, according to the federal deposit insurance corp. nine had assets above $250 billion.

bb&t had $225.7 billion in assets at the end of 2018, while suntrust had $215.5 billion. the banks expect the merger to close in the fourth quarter and project it will produce some $1.6 billion in annual cost cuts by 2022.

""i think the green light for this deal was the relaxation of the regulatory rules,"" said piper jaffray & co. senior research analyst kevin barker. but ""time will tell"" whether the deal works, he said, adding that the firms have to address cultural issues and make sure valuable employees don't leave.

the timing of the announcement is a sign of the more favorable regulatory environment.

bb&t is currently operating under an agreement with the fed to improve its anti-money-laundering controls, a situation that likely would have prevented such a deal from moving forward under the democratic administration of president obama.

mr. king said bb&t is in the ""very final stages"" of getting the order lifted, and he doesn't expect it to get in the way of the required regulatory approvals.

rep. maxine waters , a tough critic of banks who recently became the chairwoman of the house committee on financial services, said she would be examining the deal closely. ""the proposed merger raises many questions and deserves serious scrutiny,"" she said in a statement.

until recently, messrs. rogers and king had touted plans to grow the banks on their own. but the two executives, who have known each other for years, concluded that a combination was the best way for both banks to adapt to the rapidly changing business.

it wasn't an easy decision, mr. king said. ""i woke up in the middle of the night thinking of alpheus branch turning in his grave,"" he said, referring to one of founders of bb&t, whose last name has always been reflected in the bank's name. ""it's not about looking backwards, it's about looking forwards.""

58,2019-02-08,"when hollywood directors recast a part in a movie, they tend to be discreet about it. mortgage lenders are quiet about recasting, too.

a recast refers to a borrower who makes an additional principal payment and then asks the bank to re-amortize the loan at the existing interest rate. the result is that while the loan term remains the same, monthly payments are reduced. wells fargo, bank of america, jpmorgan chase and quicken loans offer mortgage recasts on some, though not all, of their loans.recasts aren't well known for a few reasons. record-low interest rates in recent years made refinancing the go-to approach for borrowers looking to save on monthly payments. also, lenders make little or no money when recasting -- chase and wells fargo charge nothing; bank of america levies a $250 fee at most.

with interest rates now trending higher, more customers are interested in recasts, said wells fargo spokesman tom goyda. the tax cuts and jobs act, enacted in december 2017 will result in over 28 million more taxpayers taking the standard deduction as opposed to itemizing deductions, according to estimates by the joint committee on taxation, a congressional committee. that means fewer households are making use of the mortgage-interest deduction to lower their tax bill come april, said laila pence, president of newport beach, calif.-based pence wealth management and pence real estate.

borrowers must call or write their lender to ask if their mortgage is eligible for recasting. the homeowner will usually be asked to sign an agreement, but unlike mortgage refinancing, there's no credit check and the paperwork and fees are nominal. it usually takes only a month or two for the new payments to take hold.

in some ways, recasting is the flip-side of the better-known strategy of making additional principal payments, which reduces the length of the loan term but keeps monthly payments the same. but the two maneuvers can co-exist: people who either make a single lump payment or have made a number of extra payments over the years -- such as borrowers who make bi-weekly rather than monthly mortgage payments -- can ask their lenders later on to recast the mortgage.

making extra or excess mortgage payments will shorten the term of the loan, thus saving a homeowner thousands of dollars in interest. paying down principal plus recasting also saves on interest over the life of the loan, but not as much as simple prepayment, because the loan term remains the same.

lenders have various minimum prepayment amounts, which they call ""curtailments,"" for recasting: wells fargo's is generally $20,000 ""but will consider smaller amounts on a case-by-case basis,"" said mr. goyda. bank of america requires a $1,000 to $6,000 pre-payment, depending on the loan. chase has no minimum.

ms. pence, the wealth manager, generally tries to talk clients with low mortgage rates out of any kind of pre-payment because ""there are so many alternatives for what to do with that money,"" she said. but clients who are severely risk adverse and tempted to simply hang onto cash can benefit from a recast that gives them an immediate savings -- especially if they are taking the standard deduction, she said.

a few things to consider about mortgage recasting:

-- deduction decisions. under the 2017 tax reform, the maximum amount of mortgage interest that can be deducted was reduced from interest on principal of up to $1 million to $750,000. but the law grandfathered in the $1 million limit for loans that predate the reforms, according to nicole kaeding, director of federal projects at the tax foundation, a washington-based think tank. homeowners who currently write off mortgage interest on loans above $750,000 should carefully run numbers before relinquishing a no-longer-available deduction, advised ms. pence.

-- availabilty varies. banks handle recast requests on a case-by-case basis, and not all loans are eligible because of restrictions imposed by various programs or investors. quicken loans offers recasts for many conforming loans. many of the jumbo loans it originates, which have amounts that start at $484,851 in most parts of the country and go up to $726,525 in high-price areas, are handled by servicers, which may be able to offer a recast.

-- alternative investments. mortgage holders who currently have low, fixed-rate loans should carefully consider whether other conservative investments -- such as high-quality bonds -- might result in higher returns that would exceed any savings in monthly payments.

to see if recasting is right for you, try an online calculator at www.free-online-calculator-use.com/mortgage-recast-calculator.html. users input their mortgage balance, current payment and how much additional equity they want to add. the calculator determines the new monthly payment. the calculator then compares how many months or years would be shaved off the mortgage term if the prepayment is made without a recast.

for example, 15 years into a $1 million mortgage at roughly 4%, a $100,000 prepayment will lower the monthly note by roughly $750 a month. alternatively, the same additional equity added without a recast would shave about three years off of the life of a loan.

59,2019-01-18,"bank of america corp .'s wealth-management business did what its wall street rivals couldn't during a wild fourth quarter: it grew its revenue.

for the parent of merrill lynch and u.s. trust , wealth-management revenue rose 7% from a year earlier to $4.99 billion. that is as stock-market swings at the end of 2018 hurt other brokerage firms, diminishing client account balances and generating lower fees for personal-financial advice.wealth-management head andy sieg said the result represents the highest quarterly revenue since bank of america bought merrill lynch a decade ago. while client balances at merrill lynch shrunk as markets fell, mr. sieg said brokers have been recruiting clients and gathering new assets more aggressively because of pay changes that the firm introduced two years ago. those changes make merrill's compensation structure more aggressive than some rivals', rewarding growth in assets and client debt and punishing the lack of it via pay clawbacks.

meanwhile, morgan stanley , jpmorgan chase & co . and wells fargo & co . each reported steep declines in fourth-quarter revenue in their wealth-management arms.

as brokerages have been shifting customers into fee-based accounts from commissions, firms' fortunes are more closely tied to market moves. they typically charge 1% to 2% of the value of customer assets, meaning a client with a $1.5 million investment account pays $15,000 to $30,000 a year. income from advisory fees surged as balances ballooned during the stock market's nine-year boom, but renewed volatility in the fourth quarter shows brokerages can't rely on their asset stockpiles growing on autopilot as they did for much of the past decade.

executives say charging fees makes for more reliable revenue since commissions tend to be sporadic, and regulatory efforts in recent years have given firms more reason to prefer fees. the labor department's fiduciary rule was thrown out last year by a u.s. circuit court, but firms had made substantial shifts toward fees before its demise.

at morgan stanley , fee-based assets now represent 45% of total client assets, and chief executive james gorman said thursday that he expects the share to eventually be more than half. there, wealth-management revenue dropped 6%, to $4.14 billion, in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. ""results reflect the difficult environment,"" the firm said in its earnings release.

for jpmorgan , revenue in the unit fell 5% from a year earlier to $3.44 billion, thanks to lower investment-management fees. wells fargo said brokerage revenue slid 9% to $3.96 billion because of smaller asset fees and other items.",Document J000000020190118ef1i0001a
60,2019-01-17,"bank of america corp. said wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings rose sharply, helped by rising interest rates and lower taxes.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c.-based bank, the second largest in the u.s. by assets, was $7.28 billion, compared with $2.37 billion a year earlier. per share earnings were 70 cents. analysts polled by refinitiv had expected 63 cents.a year earlier, the bank's profit was hit by a large charge related to the corporate tax overhaul passed in late 2017. excluding that charge, profit for the quarter rose 39%. full-year 2018 profit of $28.15 billion is the largest in the lender's history.

in recent months, investors grew gloomy about banks' prospects and sold off shares. after bank of america's earnings report, the lender's shares rose more than 7%, the largest increase in more than six years.

fourth-quarter revenue was $22.74 billion, up from $20.44 billion a year earlier. analysts had expected $22.4 billion.

the bank was the latest big lender to benefit from the federal reserve's rate increases. higher rates mean banks can charge more for loans and often means they have to pay more interest on deposits. but the fed's slow pace has allowed big banks to charge borrowers more without having to significantly increase payouts to depositors. bank of america paid 0.63% on u.s. interest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter, compared with 0.50% in the third.

the results also reflected chief executive brian moynihan's yearslong revamp of the bank. under his tenure, bank of america has cut expenses, pared back risk and focused on plain-vanilla products like primary consumer checking accounts. loans at bank of america grew by 1.2% in the third quarter from a year earlier, while deposits rose 5.5% over that period. expenses fell 1.1%.

bank of america's earnings were ""best in class,"" wrote susan roth katzke, an analyst at credit suisse group ag.

profit rose in all of the bank's major businesses, from consumer banking to wealth management and markets.

investment-banking revenue fell 4.9%. that business has slipped in important areas including u.s. mergers and last fall named a new head.

trading revenue fell 5.8%. competitors also posted trading declines due to market volatility in late 2018.

banks face a number of challenges. this is the last quarter in which earnings will benefit from favorable comparisons to a period when corporate tax rates were higher, and the fed has signaled a more cautious approach to future rate increases.

bank of america chief financial officer paul donofrio said wednesday that the lender can continue to increase net interest income -- the difference between the revenue from a bank's assets compared with the expenses of paying depositors -- without additional fed rate increases, as long as loans and deposits continue to grow.

61,2018-12-21,"merrill lynch settled claims some of its financial advisers sold shares in companies the investment bank was helping to take public -- including facebook inc . and linkedin corp . -- to family members and business associates, violating a rule meant to prevent such sales, a regulator said thursday.

merrill sold shares to family members and contacts who were brokers at other firms 1,462 times between 2010 and this past march, according to the financial industry regulatory authority .finra said financial advisers at the company, a unit of bank of america corp ., sold stock in this manner to 149 customer accounts related to 325 public offerings over the eight-year period.

""we have enhanced our policies and procedures to properly identify clients who are ineligible to receive ipo shares and to prevent similar conduct in the future,"" a merrill lynch spokesman said.

merrill agreed to pay $6 million, including a $5.5 million fine and disgorgement of about $490,000 in proceeds related to the sales. it neither admitted nor denied finra's allegations.

private companies transfer shares to investment banks they have hired to take them public, allowing the banks to sell shares to their retail customers. a finra rule prohibits brokerages handling offerings from selling shares to restricted persons, including the immediate family members of financial advisers.

ipo shares are valuable because they are often priced to rise, creating gains for investors and attracting more shareholders to the stock.

merrill became aware that employees were selling ipo shares to prohibited accounts around may 2012, when a worker in its albany, n.y., office noticed a financial adviser sold facebook ipo shares to an account held by a customer with the same last name as the adviser, according to a settlement document between finra and merrill.

the bank determined that customer was the adviser's father. the following september, the company began an internal review of sales of ipo shares to determine if any shares had been sold to advisers' immediate family members.

62,2018-12-21,"the european commission suspects deutsche bank ag, credit suisse group ag, credit agricole sa and another global bank of colluding to manipulate a multi-trillion-dollar government-backed bond market, escalating a long running probe.

the european union's executive arm, which opened the investigation almost three years ago, said in a statement thursday that banks will now lay out their defenses. if found guilty, they could face a fine of up to 10% of their annual world-wide revenue.the commission didn't name the banks. deutsche bank, credit suisse and france's credit agricole confirmed they were among the four. shares of deutsche bank closed down 7%, while credit suisse shares ended 3.8% lower. credit agricole shares fell 4%.

other banks including bank of america corp. had previously said in filings that regulators had asked for information about their trading of such bonds. bank of america declined to comment.

another bank, nomura holdings inc., that had been probed in the case said it isn't among the four banks.

""deutsche bank has proactively cooperated with the european commission in this matter and does not expect a financial penalty,"" a spokesman said. ""as this is an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further.""

credit suisse said the case refers to trading by a single employee who left the bank in early 2016.

""we do not believe any credit suisse employees engaged in anticompetitive conduct, and we hope to dispel the concerns raised by the ec,"" a spokesman said in an emailed statement.

the commission said that between 2009 and 2015 the four banks may have exchanged sensitive information and agreed on prices of u.s. dollar-denominated supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds, known as ssa bonds. those are issued by entities like the world bank and european government agencies. contact took place mainly online, it added.

authorities in europe, the u.k. and the u.s. started investigating alleged collusion in ssa bonds more than three years ago, in one of a series of alleged market-rigging cases that have sent traders to jail and cost banks billions of dollars in fines.

the cases exposed a culture of back scratching and crude banter between traders carrying out customer orders and stained the reputations of some of the world's largest banks. to avoid repeats, regulators toughened rules, made market reforms around benchmark rate setting and demanded remedial action by banks around their processes.

the u.k. regulator, the financial conduct authority, told traders involved in its investigation a year ago that they had closed the case without action, people familiar with the matter said. a justice department investigation is still open, according to the people and bank filings.

64,2018-11-24,"citigroup inc. was nearly four years removed from its near-death financial crisis experience when michael o'neill became its chairman in 2012, but its problems were hardly behind it. the bank had just failed the federal reserve's stress test, and billions of dollars of toxic assets remained on the books.

mr. o'neill came to citigroup with a reputation as perhaps the country's foremost turnaround banker, having first earned that status at continental illinois national bank and trust -- at the time, the biggest-ever u.s. bank failure -- then at a predecessor of bank of america corp., and as chief executive of bank of hawaii corp.within months, the board replaced the bank's crisis-era chief executive, vikram pandit, with michael corbat, who had been working closely with mr. o'neill on divesting unwanted assets.

in early november, mr. o'neill announced he was leaving citigroup at year's end. the journal met with him at citigroup's new headquarters overlooking manhattan's tribeca neighborhood. the interview has been edited and condensed.

wsj: so what distinguishes a career as a turnaround banker from just being a banker?

mr. o'neill: it started at continental. i was just a normal sort of banker. i, like many other people in the bank, was posted to workout jobs. i was remarkably unsuccessful trying to get money back from people who either didn't have it or wanted to keep it. i ended up being the chief of staff for the chairman, and was involved in lots of restructuring there. it was the first major bank bankruptcy, i learned a lot along the way there. what's nice about it is, typically you're brought in to resolve a problem you didn't create. i think it's very tough to create a problem and then work your way through it. not impossible, but you spend a lot of time saying, i was right at the time and i was unlucky. but that's irrelevant at that point. so it's nice to have free run.

wsj: you weren't at citigroup prior to the crisis, a period for which bank boards were blamed for letting management run amok. when you became chairman, the perception was the opposite -- that you were the person really running the bank, not the ceo. was that true?

mr. o'neill: no, it was not true, and i did not like the perception. i'm a non-executive chairman, which means i don't make day to day decisions. we made a lot of changes in the board, and one of the things that boards do is make sure the management running the strategic plan is appropriate for the time. but i never felt like i was running the company.

wsj: the abruptness of mr. pandit's resignation seemed to play into the perception of citi as a mess at the top. are there things you would have done differently?

mr. o'neill: well, your characterization i think is fair. mr. pandit and i had a conversation -- which he has said publicly, i've not talked about this before -- in which he said it was time to go. the job had gone from being strategic and firefighting to essentially continuing to cleanse the bank of bad assets and to begin executing the new strategy. that was not as much of interest to him as what he had done prior. there were internal breaches that effectively negated the discussions vikram and i had. there were leaks that were not always factual, generally not factual. that were malicious. the way it played out was unfortunate. i think well of him. he did a great job for us when he was here.

wsj: you've proposed bank breakups before, notably when you were considering returning to bank of america in 2009. but that's not the direction citigroup has gone.

mr. o'neill: excuse me. eight hundred and fifty billion and 70 businesses were divested. citi broke up. we did more than anyone ever has done before, alright? we basically purged the bank of troubled assets, or businesses that were not appropriate to the new conditions. we have replaced $850 billion of very questionable assets with $850 billion of what we think and hope are good assets. i don't know how much more one needs to do to say that restructuring has occurred. now, have we kept two major lines of business? yeah. consumer and institutional. to be sure, those are bedrock businesses. but they're run very differently than they used to be run.

wsj: other banks have recombined their chairman and chief executive roles since the crisis, though against some vocal shareholder objection. why isn't citigroup doing that?

mr. o'neill: i understand full well that the chairmanship is a trophy for ceos. i also believe that the non-executive position is probably the right way to govern when you start from scratch. i don't think the chairmanship should be given as a reward, or taken away as a penalty. what i said to mike corbat is, you've done a great job, you're well perceived by the board, we understand the nature of american banking. do you want to be considered for it? mike, in his usual way, very unemotional, basically concluded it wasn't worth the calories we would have to burn to get it done. he puts the company first.

wsj: do you believe the megabank model spawned by citigroup -- spanning commercial, investment, and consumer banking -- still fundamentally works?

mr. o'neill: today i would not want to try and create citigroup or any of the other large banks. we are -- i won't say we are an accident of history -- we are history. and unfortunately time changes and the environment changes, and so today we've got other challenges. we've got fintech, potential disruptors. we've got cybersecurity. we've got all sorts of risks that we did not have before. do i believe that the basic model can be made to work? yes. but with constant mid-course corrections, and those need to happen more frequently than they did in the past.

wsj: are you retiring from citigroup, or from the banking industry entirely?

mr. o'neill: i failed retirement twice before. i'm determined to pass it this time. after retiring from bank of hawaii, i moved to the u.k. and enrolled in a graduate program in early modern european history. i was about to begin work on my dissertation when the call about possible citi board duty came in late 2008. i decided to take on the directorship, never really began work in earnest on the dissertation, and moved back to the u.s. i'm giving consideration to picking up the loose ends and restarting my research after an interruption of 10 years. we'll see?

65,2018-11-15,"warren buffett's berkshire hathaway inc. is boosting its bet on the u.s. banking industry.

the omaha, neb., conglomerate took a $4 billion stake in jpmorgan chase & co. in the third quarter, giving it sizable stakes in three of the four largest american banks. jpmorgan is the largest u.s. bank by assets.berkshire holds roughly 9% stakes in bank of america corp. and wells fargo & co., the second and fourth largest by assets, and is the top shareholder of both banks. the new investment in jpmorgan gives berkshire about a 1% stake and doesn't place the company among jpmorgan's top five shareholders, according to factset.

berkshire also took a new stake during the quarter in pittsburgh bank pnc financial services group inc. and increased its holdings of goldman sachs group inc., bank of america, bank of new york mellon corp. and u.s. bancorp. other banking investments include wells fargo and m&t bank corp.

berkshire disclosed the new positions as of sept. 30 in a securities filing wednesday.

berkshire has made several high-profile investments in banking and payment companies over the years. in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, berkshire provided much-needed capital to bank of america and goldman as both struggled to keep the confidence of investors.

berkshire also owns stakes in american express co., mastercard inc. and visa inc. and recently invested about $600 million in two financial-technology companies.

mr. buffett has said he holds a small personal stake in jpmorgan, and he told yahoo finance earlier this year that berkshire should have invested in the bank, calling it a ""terrifically run operation."" the new berkshire investment in jpmorgan follows a number of existing ties between the two companies.

jpmorgan declined to comment.

66,2018-11-13,"big banks are enlisting the local dmv in their fight against identity fraud.

lenders including jpmorgan chase & co., bank of america corp., wells fargo & co. and citigroup inc. are looking for ways to link up with databases at state departments of motor vehicles and other government offices to make sure potential customers are who they say they are.motor-vehicle departments are appealing partners for banks as more people are opening accounts online. at the dmv, applicants typically must appear in person, at least initially, with a stack of documents including birth certificates and social security cards that are verified by trained staffers.

identity verification, a perennial problem for banks, has taken on greater importance since some high-profile data breaches exposed loads of customer data that swindlers can exploit to open accounts. banks also are looking for ways to combat a rapidly growing and particularly vexing scam that involves made-up borrowers.

if banks can enlist dmv help, they could see big savings. financial firms globally spent $6 billion on identity-verification technology in 2017, according to consultancy aite group, a sum that is expected to grow to $10 billion by 2021. branch employees are still sometimes relied upon to gather much of the required documentation to verify a customer's identity, making it harder for banks to pare physical locations and open more digital accounts.

the task is especially complicated in the u.s. while many other countries have national ids, the u.s. relies on a patchwork of state and federal agencies to establish identity. banks are working with technology vendors and other partners to coordinate their efforts across state lines.

""dmvs are the largest footprint for in-person identity proofing,"" said matt thompson, who was recently hired from capital one financial corp. to work on new forms of identification and bank-dmv partnerships for idemia usa. ""we can build on that to create a trusted digital identity for people who want it to be known on the internet that they're not a dog.""

privacy concerns may also stand in the way. banks are wary of being caught up in debates about nationalizing state id efforts.

some local officials worry that states will be forced to bear responsibility -- and potentially blame -- for whatever consequences come from the use of licenses as bank identifiers. ""we were trying to keep kids from buying beer; now we're talking about financial transactions using a smartphone and a driver's license,"" said maine secretary of state matthew dunlap.

working with banks could provide a way for dmvs to preserve their role as critical identity gateways, especially in a world where fewer people drive. the fees from such a service could help cover the costs of technology upgrades.

iowa department of transportation director mark lowe said he regularly talks to financial companies about identity applications.

""i can't guarantee in 30 years we'll be dealing with driving in the same way, but i have a very good sense we'll be involved in identity management,"" he said.

a group of financial firms including jpmorgan, wells fargo and bank of america earlier this year helped launch the better identity coalition to push state and federal agencies to help them with identity verification. the organization is meeting with officials around the country, according to coordinator jeremy grant.

banks also have stepped up their efforts to work with the social security administration to check customer information. jpmorgan and wells fargo, among others, are working with the agency on ways to identify and cross-check customer information, such as whether a customer is deceased or is an active service member, when accounts are opened digitally, according to people familiar with the matter.

congress recently smoothed the path for such partnerships. an overhaul of banking regulations enacted in may included a provision that guaranteed banks' ability to use a digital image of a driver's license, which some state laws could have prevented.

it also required the social security administration to offer financial firms an electronic database for verifying social security numbers for the purpose of fraud prevention.

""digital evolution in banking is fantastic, but along with it has come increased incidence of fraud and identity theft,"" said josh denney, director of government affairs for bbva compass, which helped formulate the license provision in the bill. ""the new laws allow us to reach more consumers and also do more to prevent fraud.""

some lenders already allow their customers to snap a picture of their license when opening a checking account on a mobile app. but that data isn't checked definitively against a dmv database. instead, the image is examined, sometimes by a person, to determine if it has the necessary authentication marks.

that may not go far enough, said ian grossman, vice president at the american association of motor vehicle administrators, which represents dmvs. ""we know that high-quality counterfeit credentials are in circulation,"" he said. ""but one thing it will never have is the record at the issuing agency.""

mr. grossman said aamva is also working with vendors on expanding an existing network used by states to verify that a person doesn't have a license elsewhere.

banks would also pay states a fee to use the network.

67,2018-11-08,"for months, amazon.com inc. has wrestled with what city or cities to choose for its next headquarters. once it decides, it will face another challenge: how the multiple-hq arrangement actually works.

amazon's decision to build another home after a yearlong search puts it in diverse company. such companies as telecom provider centurylink inc. and bank of america corp. operate with what are effectively multiple headquarters as a result of mergers or ceo changes. others, like massachusetts and luxembourg-based samsonite international sa, have sought them out for tax advantages or to draw talent.the wall street journal reported monday that amazon plans to split its second headquarters evenly between two locations rather than pick one city for hq2, a decision that will spread the impact of a massive new office across two communities.

todd mckinnon, chief executive of okta inc., an enterprise-software company with headquarters in san francisco and, since 2017, in san jose, calif., said he was initially hesitant about designating a second headquarters. but the company wanted to recruit more from the south bay area, so it created an official second home base to attract talent who wouldn't be content in a second-fiddle office. the company now has around 120 workers in san jose and 700 in san francisco.

mr. mckinnon's skepticism came from his time as head engineer at salesforce.com inc., when he said he had seen the san francisco company open a san mateo, calif., office that failed to take off as a talent magnet. okta, he said, pushed to make sure it staffed up quickly in san jose so the office wouldn't languish.

""you can't let it happen organically,"" mr. mckinnon said.

a salesforce spokeswoman confirmed the san mateo office closed in 2017 after more than a decade, adding that the company was ""excited to bring more of our employees together"" at its san francisco campus, which includes the newly built salesforce tower.

some executives at companies with more than one base of operations say spreading out senior management gives them access to more customers and diverse insights.

""companies will be left behind if they don't do it,"" said peter gassner, founder of veeva systems. its executives are scattered around the country, including in philadelphia and pleasanton, calif., where the cloud-software company is based. ""it's just our headquarters in name,"" he said of the latter.

to reinforce that location doesn't matter, he said, if a meeting has remote participants, then everyone else must individually videoconference in -- even if they are sitting in the same office: ""that's the etiquette,"" mr. gassner said.

some outfits with a global footprint, such as law firms and architecture firms, eschew a headquarters altogether, partly to avoid giving clients the impression that any office is second-tier.

to mimic a water-cooler-style atmosphere, software company qualtrics -- which has headquarters in provo, utah, and in seattle -- keeps its snack areas outfitted with screens displaying live feeds of snack areas elsewhere so employees in different places can strike up conversations. the company's ceo is based in utah, while its engineering head and chief experience officer are in seattle.

""as long as the decision makers are clear, then it's not like there's a power grab,"" said mike maughan, head of global insights at qualtrics. he said the dual arrangement helps reinforce that the company -- with offices in dublin and sydney -- is comfortable working across time zones.

tech companies aren't the only ones to embrace multiple headquarters. houston-based halliburton opened a dubai headquarters in 2007 as energy projects in the middle east and africa proliferated.

unilever has long operated as two separate listed entities, with bases in both london and the netherlands -- the legacy of a 1929 merger between english soap maker lever bros. and dutch margarine producer margarine unie. it recently tried to consolidate the dual structure, saying it would help simplify business operations. but it jettisoned plans to shift operations to the netherlands after investors protested: the move would have lost the company its place in the u.k.'s ftse 100 index.

proliferating mergers and a more-global approach to banking has produced diffuse headquarters in that sector. a decade ago, most top executives at bank of america were based at headquarters in charlotte, n.c. since then, senior managers have fanned out across the east coast. the bank bought merrill lynch in 2009, expanding its new york presence, and in 2010, brian moynihan, who lives near boston, became ceo, bolstering its presence there.

some management experts remain skeptical of far-flung leadership teams. qinghai wang, a university of central florida professor who has studied the link between headquarters locations and stock performance, said dispersed senior management can make it harder for executives to exchange information. ""decision-making should be concentrated,"" he said.

many companies with multiple headquarters say top managers are on the road for much of the week anyway and technology keeps them tethered.

shreeram mudambi, strategic-management professor at temple university, said he expects dual headquarters to become more common as technology improves and companies scour the globe for talent. still, he is skeptical that two headquarters can be equal in status.

""the buck has to stop somewhere,"" he said. ""there's a ceo, and the question is, where does the ceo sit?""

68,2018-11-05,"merrill lynch is cutting broker pay to trim costs -- while at the same time providing an incentive to promote cross-selling of parent-bank products and spur growth.

starting in january, brokers won't be paid on all of the business they produce, bank of america corp.'s wealth-management arm late thursday told its ranks of about 17,000 advisers. instead, merrill said it will pay brokers on 97% of their wealth-management production monthly. the penalty maxes out at about $1.6 million in annual brokerage and investment-advisory production, meaning an adviser will be paid fully on the business they produce above that level.the changes would likely mean a 3% pay cut for the average merrill adviser, who produces about $1 million in annual business. financial advisers at merrill lynch and other brokerages typically keep a portion of what they generate through asset-management fees, commissions and other factors. in 2018, an adviser producing $1 million in annual business kept 42%, or $420,000.

advisers will be able to recover some of the money they lose through bonuses rewarding growth and the firm said it would award top performers with extra pay.

merrill brokers's sales of bank of america products such as mortgages, money-market funds and margin loans won't be affected by the change. that means brokers will continue to get a full cut of the revenue produced by selling bank products to wealth-management clients. merrill lynch said that the money advisers make on bank products is relatively low. retirement accounts also are excluded from the shift.

executives say the 2019 compensation plan builds on a revamped system put in place for this year. but the changes have sparked dissent among merrill's ranks. brokers say they feel cheated out of pay they have earned and bristle at what they say is an incentive to sell more bank products, like checking accounts, to wealthy clients.

merrill executives said the changes are meant to cut costs and juice growth. adviser compensation is at a record level in 2018 and has outpaced revenue, one person said. market performance is one reason behind the climb, with early-year gains in major stock indexes boosting monthly paychecks for advisers.

last year's revamped compensation system helped bring in the most new clients in at least five years.

still, money flowing into fee-based accounts, the best gauge for new money coming into merrill, has slipped in recent quarters. merrill in 2018 began clawing back pay from advisers who didn't meet minimum growth targets. merrill has said about one-third of its ranks have been penalized with a clawback this year.

some advisers stand to lose even more next year. merrill will punish advisers who fail to meet certain minimum targets for net new asset and liability growth and new customer acquisition, by sliding the adviser down 2 percentage points on the so-called cash grid used to lay out production tiers and payout rates. that means the $1 million producer who misses both targets next year would see a pay cut of about 7.7%.

69,2018-10-27,"bank of america corp. on friday said vice chairman terry laughlin, who oversaw the bank's sprawling wealth-management business, died unexpectedly at age 63.

mr. laughlin, a member of the bank's executive-management team, was a close adviser to chief executive brian moynihan. the two had worked together on and off for decades.mr. moynihan took the top job in 2010 with a mandate to repair the teetering bank, and appointed mr. laughlin to senior roles including salvaging the bank's troubled mortgage portfolio and helping resubmit its federal reserve stress test.

most recently, mr. laughlin oversaw its wealth-management franchises, merrill lynch global wealth management and u.s. trust, with client balances of more than $2.8 trillion and 19,000 wealth advisers.

after working for a local bank, mr. laughlin took a job at fleet financial group inc. in providence, r.i., where he met mr. moynihan in the 1990s. mr. moynihan came to rely heavily on mr. laughlin's counsel. mr. laughlin helped teach mr. moynihan a method of valuing potential bank acquisitions, the bank of america ceo said. ""we got along because both of us were about getting the work done,"" mr. moynihan said.

mr. laughlin went to work at merrill lynch before its acquisition by bank of america. in 2009, he became ceo of onewest bank, a california lender. bank of america hired him in 2010, months after mr. moynihan took the ceo role.

70,2018-10-23,"there's less free money to go around for banks.

after nearly three years of rate increases from the federal reserve, customers are pulling billions of dollars out of accounts that don't earn interest and putting their money into higher-yielding alternatives. that will crimp banks' ability to increase profits going forward.the four largest u.s. banks -- jpmorgan chase & co., bank of america corp., wells fargo & co. and citigroup inc. -- reported a combined 5% drop in u.s. deposits that earn no interest in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. customers withdrew more than $30 billion from u.s. bank accounts that don't earn interest over the year that ended june 30, the first such annual decline in more than a decade, according to federal deposit insurance corp. data.

these deposits largely consist of business and consumer checking accounts and are considered particularly valuable because banks can use these no-cost deposits to make loans. as short-term interest rates rise, they become even more lucrative.

while the fed started raising short-term rates in december 2015, banks have been able to boost earnings by charging higher rates on loans even as they pay depositors nearly nothing. but after eight incremental fed increases, some customers are moving their money to capture higher yields elsewhere, threatening future gains in bank profits.

some depositors are simply moving their cash to new bank accounts that offer higher interest rates, in line with the rising fed-funds rate. others are seeking out slightly more-lucrative options farther afield, such as money-market funds, certificates of deposit and bonds issued by companies and governments.

deposits that earn no interest are ""the crown jewel of the bank funding base,"" said allen tischler, a senior vice president at moody's investors service. ""you start losing that and you end up not being able to benefit from future rate increases.""

before the financial crisis, noninterest-bearing deposits made up a much smaller portion of money at banks. in 2007, the fed started cutting interest rates in an effort to combat mounting economic problems. the central bank left them near zero for seven years in an unprecedented move.

for many individual depositors, rates were so low for so long on money-market and savings accounts across the industry that they just left their money in checking accounts that earned nothing at all.

noninterest deposits became more attractive to corporate customers because the government offered unlimited insurance for many of these in the years after the crisis. another incentive for corporate customers: they often earn credits to cover fees on other bank products when they put money in noninterest accounts. with rates so low, those credits were often worth more than the customers would have earned in an interest-bearing account.

when the federal reserve started raising rates in late 2015, bank profits quickly benefited. that was because lenders started charging more on certain loans like credit cards and lines of credit to businesses, but didn't immediately pay depositors more.

slowly, lenders started paying higher rates to some savvy corporate and wealth-management customers, who might otherwise take their money elsewhere. still, money in noninterest accounts continued to grow.

that is now reversing, if slowly. noninterest deposits of around $3.2 trillion were equal to 26.3% of domestic deposits at u.s. banks in the second quarter, according to fdic data. although way above precrisis levels, the ratio is down from 27.5% a year ago. that equates to about $30.6 billion less in noninterest accounts.

the push for a better deposit deal is coming mostly from businesses, which have more to gain because of their large amounts of cash. lenders including bank of america, jpmorgan and regional lender pnc financial services group inc. all said on earnings calls that business customers in the third quarter moved money from accounts that earn zero interest into accounts that pay more.

bank of america, for instance, said average corporate noninterest deposits fell 11%, compared with last year's third quarter. meanwhile, corporate deposits that earned interest rose 49%.

""does it make sense to have the money in a noninterest account? it used to,"" said tom hunt, director of treasury services at the association for financial professionals. when the trade group surveyed its members who work in corporate finance, it found companies in 2018 kept less of their short-term cash in bank deposits and more in higher-paying investments.

the result: not only do banks have to pay up for a greater share of their deposits, they also have to pay more on the deposits that pay interest. both factors weigh on bank lending profit margins, which are closely watched by investors.

""noninterest-bearing deposits are the goose that lays the golden egg for a bank,"" said gerard cassidy, an analyst at rbc capital markets. their decline, he said, is one reason the profit boost from rising interest rates will likely end over the next year or so.

71,2018-10-16,"bank of america could afford to be a bit bolder -- not that it has to.the lender has long been known to analysts as one that does particularly well in a rising-rate environment. its large and loyal deposit base shields it somewhat from competition on the funding side, while rates on its credit card and business loans adjust upward quickly.

this is playing out now as the federal reserve continues to raise rates. bank of america on monday said third-quarter profit jumped 32% from a year earlier on a 4% rise in revenue, both results beating expectations.

bank of america's net interest margin was 2.42%, up from 2.38% the previous quarter and 2.36% a year before. total deposits rose 5% from a year earlier. the company said its sensitivity to higher rates actually increased since the previous quarter.

slowing lending growth is a concern, though, as are the bank's somewhat lackluster investment-banking results. total loans, including some runoff assets left over from years past, were basically flat from a year earlier. core loans rose by 3%, slowing from 5% growth in the second quarter. loans in the consumer unit were up a respectable 6%, but business-unit loan growth was slow at just 2%. chief financial officer paul donofrio said this is partly because large corporate clients are flush with cash thanks to tax cuts.

bank of america also has lost ground to rivals such as jpmorgan chase in investment banking. the good news is that management recognizes this and wants to step things up. ""i know we can do better. this is about re-energizing our teams and engaging our clients better,"" mr. donofrio said monday.

bank of america's risk-averse culture has served it well under chief executive brian moynihan, who has been in place since 2010. the company doesn't need to shed its ""responsible growth"" mantra to hire a few more investment bankers or to go after a few new corporate clients. with things coming up its way on interest rates, it can afford such a move.

investors can afford to be a bit more optimistic, too. bank of america's shares, at 1.18 times book value, are reasonably priced and significantly cheaper than those of rivals such as jpmorgan and wells fargo. they can head higher if the bank just keeps doing what it has been -- riding the wave of higher rates while controlling costs. any new growth drivers it develops would be icing on the cake.

72,2018-10-16,"bank of america corp. said monday that third-quarter profit rose 32%, as higher interest rates and last year's corporate tax cut continued to lift bank earnings.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c., bank, the second largest in the u.s. by assets, was $7.167 billion, compared with $5.424 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 66 cents. analysts polled by refinitiv had expected 62 cents.revenue was $22.78 billion, from $21.84 billion a year earlier. analysts had expected $22.67 billion.

earnings continue to benefit from last year's u.s. corporate tax cut as well as interest rates. rising rates are typically good for banks because the companies turn a profit on the difference between what they pay on deposits and what they collect on loans. in september, the federal reserve raised its benchmark rate, the eighth time it has done so since it started raising rates in late 2015.

profit rose in all of the bank's major business segments but was up the most in its retail-banking and wealth-management units.

banks have been able to pocket most of the benefits from the rate increases because customers aren't broadly demanding more interest on their deposits. bank of america paid 0.50% on u.s. interest-bearing deposits in the third quarter, compared with 0.38% in the second quarter. net interest income rose 6%.

deposits grew by nearly 5% and loans were roughly flat from a year earlier. loan growth has slowed down across the banking industry since the 2016 presidential election.

quarterly expenses fell more than 2% to $13.067 billion from $13.394 billion a year earlier. the bank's income-tax expense fell more than 16%.

the investment-banking unit continued to struggle, with fees down 18% from the prior year. the unit has slipped in key businesses including u.s. mergers this year.

""we can do better,"" chief executive brian moynihan said of the business on a call with analysts monday. the bank also attributed some of the slide to sitting out highly leveraged debt deals over risk concerns.

bank of america's trading revenue fell 2.5%. trading results have been mixed across the industry. on friday, citigroup inc. said trading revenue was up 7%. jpmorgan chase & co.'s trading revenue slipped 2%.

bank stocks jumped early in the year as market volatility fueled revenue on their equities-trading desks, but they have flatlined since then. in monday trading, bank of america shares fell nearly 2%.

tuesday, investment banks goldman sachs group inc. and morgan stanley are slated to report their quarterly results.

73,2018-10-15,"bank of america corp .'s purchase of merrill lynch & co ., struck on the panic-filled 2008 weekend that lehman brothers failed, was supposed to make the lender a top-flight global investment bank.

a decade later, the bank is struggling to make good on that promise. bank of america has failed to capture the benefits of a deal-making boom that has lifted its wall street rivals. its overall investment-banking revenue in the first nine months of this year is roughly flat compared with the same period in 2010, compared with an average increase of more than 50% at u.s. peers including goldman sachs group inc . and jpmorgan chase & co .bank of america makes far more on service charges such as overdraft fees than from merger and underwriting work, and the investment bank has never contributed more than 7% of the company's revenue.

chief executive brian moynihan instead has found success with the main street businesses of retail deposits and business loans, pursuing a strategy of ""responsible growth"" with ""no excuses"" that values stability over swagger. that playbook has won over investors including warren buffett , the bank's biggest shareholder and a vocal cheerleader of mr. moynihan's.

bank executives say they want to improve in investment banking. ""we want to be in the top three, and based on our relationships and platform there's no reason we shouldn't be,"" chief operating officer tom montag said in a statement.

the bank historically has relied on the power of its national brand and deep lending relationships to drum up business, rather than cultivating a culture of superstar rainmakers. many current and former executives say the bank hasn't filled important roles with bankers who have top relationships and visit clients with the intensity needed to beat formidable competitors.

some of those executives also say the bank's conservative approach has handcuffed the firm's investment bankers, highly paid professionals who pitch big companies and governments on mergers and securities offerings. bank of america has, for instance, shied away from clients deemed to carry reputational risks that other banks are willing to take on.

the firm has grown more gun-shy after disclosing a $292 million loss earlier this year on a loan to the then-chairman of troubled south african firm steinhoff international holdings nv . lead independent director jack bovender told a trade publication that executives responsible for the deal were ""taken to the woodshed.""

in july, after the bank reported lower investment-banking revenue, mr. moynihan said on a call with analysts that the m&a team ""knows they can do a better job and are after it.""

it was mr. moynihan's predecessor, kenneth lewis, who signed the deal to buy merrill when it was flailing. the union, executives said, would create a balanced behemoth, marrying bank of america 's ready supply of capital with the deals that merrill's white-shoe bankers would gin up.

the agreement made bank of america a hero as other financial firms collapsed. but merrill's power brokers chafed at the merger with the southern consumer bank. senior bankers, used to autonomy, were asked in ensuing years to carefully track their meetings. executives were instructed to read employees' emails to check for compliance violations, people familiar with the matter said.

mr. moynihan, a low-key lawyer by trade, became ceo in 2010. the business was a bright spot early in his tenure, when the bank was dealing with big consumer loan losses. from 2010 to 2013, the firm's investment-banking revenue rose 13%.

now, however, bank of america 's rankings are slipping. it is eighth in u.s. merger revenue this year, behind jefferies financial group llc and barclays plc , according to dealogic. it also has slipped in debt businesses it has dominated for years.

twenty-eight managing directors have left the investment bank for competitors since the beginning of 2017, according to a report by recruiting firm sheffield haworth . only deutsche bank ag has seen more departures at that level. a bank of america spokeswoman said the bank has made 49 managing-director hires over that period.

the firm's conservative approach has meant tighter constraints for the investment bankers. they were barred from business with subprime lenders, even for assignments that wouldn't give bank of america much exposure to the underlying loans, according to people familiar with the matter. bankers grumbled that mr. moynihan seemed less interested in getting personally involved in deals than his counterparts at jpmorgan or goldman sachs .

74,2018-10-13,"fannie mae was receiving massive capital infusions from the treasury department, managing tens of thousands of foreclosed homes and facing bipartisan calls for its abolition when timothy mayopoulos joined the mortgage-finance company nine years ago as general counsel.

mr. mayopoulos is set to step down monday after six years as ceo. while the company and its smaller cousin, freddie mac , still operate under federal control through a legal process known as conservatorship, the firms' fortunes have rebounded along with the recovered u.s. housing sector. fannie and freddie remain at the center of america's $10 trillion home-loan market.before joining fannie, mr. mayopoulos was bank of america corp.'s general counsel -- until then-chief executive kenneth lewis, who lived down the street from him in charlotte, n.c., had him replaced on the eve of the bank's 2008 acquisition of merrill lynch & co .

from swivel chairs in a quiet corner of the company's new open-office headquarters in downtown washington, mr. mayopoulos spoke about fannie's comeback and future, and his own. here, edited excerpts from his interview with the wall street journal.

wsj: what was the biggest challenge you faced at fannie?

mr. mayopoulos: the first challenge was just trying to stabilize the company and housing markets. millions of people in foreclosure, and that was an enormous challenge for which there was no real playbook. the next challenge was getting back to profitability. the most important challenge has been the most recent one, which is changing the business model of the company to become a distributor of credit risk as opposed to a holder of credit risk.

wsj: how do you plan for the future when you don't know how congress, the executive branch, or your regulator will decide your future?

mr. mayopoulos: we recognize that we're not the ultimate decision makers about what happens to us. the real shift in mindset that happened here was people stopped thinking about what's going to happen to fannie mae and instead starting asking themselves, what should the housing system of the future look like and how can you be a part of laying the foundation for that?

wsj: there was a loud cry on both sides of the aisle in washington saying ""abolish fannie"" when you joined. you don't hear that as much now that the company is profitable. has it made life easier?

mr. mayopoulos: because we were hearing less of that, because we did become profitable, i actually worried about whether our employees would say, ""we don't really need to change."" the key to our progress has been not allowing ourselves to become complacent about the role that we have.

there was a great humiliation that came with the crisis for fannie mae . it was a very proud company -- some would say a very arrogant company -- in the past. and the experience produced much greater humility.

wsj: when it comes to housing-finance policy, what lessons has the country learned over the last decade?

mr. mayopoulos: clearly credit standards matter and they matter a lot. we've also learned that transparency matters a lot. a big challenge with housing finance leading up to the crisis is that it was really run by people with engineering or math degrees. we thought they understood what the numbers meant, but most people really didn't appreciate the risk that was embedded in what was happening.

wsj: if the treasury secretary said, ""tim, what do we do with fannie and freddie,"" what advice would you give him?

mr. mayopoulos: what i'd say is that we should separate what kind of housing finance system you would want to create from the two entities that are currently fannie and freddie. the political aspect of just talking about fannie and freddie complicates the debate.

the other thing i would say is that while housing-finance reform is important, the real crisis of housing isn't housing-finance reform -- it's really affordable housing.

wsj: when the country encountered these affordability challenges 15 years ago, people tried to solve them by relaxing underwriting standards. how confident are you that we won't do that again?

mr. mayopoulos: what we learned in the crisis is we don't do anyone any favors, certainly not to all those families that were foreclosed on, by giving people mortgages that are not sustainable. we need to solve the affordability problem by increasing the supply, not increasing the demand or the access to credit that will drive demand. we actually need to create more housing.

wsj: you were fired abruptly from bank of america , not allowed to take any belongings from your office, escorted out of the building. how did that episode change you professionally?

mr. mayopoulos: i don't know any successful professional who hasn't had unexpected turns in their career from time to time. i wouldn't attribute it to the end of my time at bank of america , but i would say one of the things a ceo needs to do is set the right tone in the organization. it's important to do two things: one is treat people respectfully at all points. and second is seek as much diversity of opinion as you possibly can. i've never sought to be the smartest guy in the room. if you're the smartest guy in the room, you have to make all of the decisions about everything. whether you deliver good news to people or bad news to people, you have to do that respectfully.

75,2018-09-20,"bank of america corp. corporate and investment banking head christian meissner is leaving the bank, according to an internal memo reviewed by the wall street journal.

the departure will mark the end of a nearly seven-year run in the role. mr. meissner was largely responsible for reshaping the unit following bank of america's financial-crisis merger with merrill lynch.mr. meissner is expected to be succeeded by matthew koder, who is currently the bank's asia-pacific president, and stay until the end of the year, the memo said.

bank of america's corporate- and investment-banking operations were a bright spot for several years after the merger, a dreary stretch that included large government fines stemming from its consumer-banking operations. but it has slipped recently, and the bank's consumer businesses have staged a big comeback.

mr. meissner became co-head in 2011 and took sole control in january 2012. the role includes overseeing the bank's lending to large companies and work advising on mergers and capital raising.

before joining bank of america in 2010, austria-born mr. meissner worked for years as an investment banker in europe at goldman sachs group inc. and lehman brothers holdings inc. he was seen as an advocate for bank of america's international ambitions and oversaw an effort to pare the corporate and investment bank's roster and focus on fewer, more lucrative, clients.

while the business still accounts for a big chunk of the bank's profit, it has fallen behind rivals by some measures. bank of america ranks fourth in global investment banking revenue so far in 2018, behind jpmorgan chase & co, goldman sachs group inc. and morgan stanley, respectively, according to dealogic.

the charlotte, n.c.-based bank had held the no. 3 spot until last year. between 2010 and 2013, bank of america occupied the runner-up spot.

investment-banking fees at bank of america fell 7% in the lender's second-quarter earnings report. ""the team knows they can do a better job and are after it,"" chief executive brian moynihan said of the investment bank's mergers-and-acquisition advisory business at the time.

some lending parameters at the bank were also recently re-evaluated after the company posted a $292 million loss involving troubled south african firm steinhoff international holdings nv.

76,2018-09-20,"bank of america corp. will pay $30 million as part of a settlement with the commodity futures trading commission related to charges that the bank tried to manipulate a benchmark for interest-rate products over a span of six years.

the cftc said wednesday that bank of america tried to manipulate the u.s. dollar international swaps and derivatives association fix, or isdafix, to help its own derivatives positions. it also accused the bank of false reporting.bank of america traders, according to the futures regulator, attempted to manipulate rates to benefit specific trading positions and influence reference rates and spreads ahead of the time the final rates were published.

""we have significantly enhanced our procedures to detect any inappropriate behavior,"" a bank of america spokesman said.

cftc director of enforcement james mcdonald said in a statement that the regulator's settlement with the bank is the commission's ninth enforcement action tied to manipulation with this benchmark.

on tuesday, the commission announced that intercapital markets llc would pay $50 million as part of a settlement with the regulator.

intercapital neither admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed to pay the $50 million penalty.

nex group plc, the company's parent, said it is ""pleased to have brought this matter to a conclusion.""

77,2018-08-22,"starting sept. 4, bank of america corp.'s merrill lynch brokerage unit will no longer sweep its customers' cash into money-market mutual funds, moving it instead into deposits at affiliated banks.

in communications distributed to its staff on monday, the brokerage said money-market funds ""will no longer be available as a sweep choice for most new accounts."" instead, clients' uninvested cash will be automatically routed to bank deposits. for six months, these bank sweep accounts will earn a ""transitional yield"" equal to that on a money-market fund; after may 2019, the yields on those deposits are likely to drop to market rates below that level.the yield on 100 large money-market mutual funds averages 1.77%, according to crane data of westboro, mass., which tracks returns on cash investments. bank sweep accounts at brokerage firms tend to pay about 0.25% on average, according to crane.

merrill's brokers will still be able to place their customers' cash in higher-yielding money-market funds but only by purchasing them manually.

the giant firm thus joins many other major brokerages, including morgan stanley and charles schwab corp ., in potentially capturing more of the income on cash balances for themselves, rather than passing most of it through to clients.

such a move has steadily become more lucrative as the federal reserve raises interest rates.

in the second quarter, with rates nearly 1 percentage point higher than they were a year earlier, brokerage firms indicated that as much as 25% of their gross profit came from what they earned off their customers' cash.

in exchange for depositing their customers' uninvested cash at banks -- often, as in merrill's case, banks affiliated with the firm -- brokerages receive hefty fees.

""today, approximately 4% of merrill lynch accounts eligible to use a money-market mutual-fund sweep option do so,"" a bank of america spokesman said. ""we're simplifying our offering, drawing clearer distinctions between cash and investment products.""

the firm will also make a greater number of money-market funds available outside the sweep program ""that are lower-cost and typically higher-yielding,"" said the spokesman.",Document J000000020180822ee8m0000z
78,2018-08-20,"a decade after the financial crisis, the wall street journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. today, we spotlight bank of america ceo brian moynihan .

when brian moynihan took on the job of chief executive of bank of america corp. in 2010, the bank's very existence seemed uncertain. after almost nine years in the role, he has lifted its stock price and earned the praise of warren buffett .the process took years. mr. moynihan, 58 years old, got the top role after ceo kenneth lewis unexpectedly announced his retirement in the fall of 2009. during that period, bank of america faced major financial problems following acquisitions of countrywide financial corp . and merrill lynch & co . to stay afloat, the bank had to take $45 billion from the government.

with the bailout funds paid back, mr. moynihan oversaw a plan to stabilize the lender and shield it from similar damage in a future crisis. that involved shedding riskier businesses and expanding through conservative lending.

for a long time, though, that turnaround plan was overshadowed by multibillion-dollar fines and other missteps, like when the bank in 2014 had to shelve a plan to buy back shares and boost its dividend for the first time in years after finding a $4 billion error in its capital calculations.

eventually, the bank was able to cut costs and boost profits through strategies like closing around 1,600 branches while strategically expanding in big cities.

around 2015, the bank turned a corner ""numerically"" and ""emotionally,"" mr. moynihan said this year.

an ohio native, the low-key mr. moynihan joined bank of america through its 2004 acquisition of boston-based fleetboston financial corp . he previously held a number of roles at the bank, including running consumer and small-business banking.

after donald trump's surprise 2016 election, bank stocks broadly jumped. bank of america shares surged 74% between then and the end of 2017.

for 2017, the bank posted a $21.1 billion profit, excluding an adjustment from the tax cut, roughly matching the bank's profit record from 2006. the bank issued millions of new shares during the crisis, however, so its per-share earnings remain far below where they were precrisis. likewise its shares, unlike those of competitors such as jpmorgan chase & co . and wells fargo & co ., remain below precrisis levels.

the bank has also gotten approval to continue boosting buybacks and its dividend. mr. buffett, whose berkshire hathaway inc . threw the bank a lifeline with a 2011 investment and now is its largest shareholder, has publicly praised mr. moynihan.

""bank of america has done a sensational job under brian moynihan ,"" mr. buffett said in a television interview last year. ""brian had all kinds of problems when he came in, they were not of his own doing . . . he just set out step-by-step to bring the bank back.""

mr. moynihan has shown no indication he plans to leave the role anytime soon. ""i've got some room to run, i hope,"" he said earlier this year.",Document J000000020180820ee8k0000h
79,2018-08-01,"goldman sachs group inc . has simon, an online platform that sells complex investment products to mom-and-pop investors. bank of america corp . and morgan stanley are throwing their weight behind luma.

the two firms are backing a new company, luma financial technologies, to connect retail brokers seeking market-linked certificates of deposit, structured notes and other products to the banks that issue them.bank of america and morgan stanley will invest in luma and sell their own products to its clients. luma's software and its chief executive, tim bonacci, come from navian capital, a wholesaler of structured products since 2011.

mr. bonacci declined to comment on the financial terms, as did a spokesman for morgan stanley. a representative for bank of america couldn't be reached for comment.

structured notes are custom-built by banks out of options and other derivatives. investors pay an upfront sum -- helping banks to fund their operations -- and receive a future payout based on the performance of another asset, such as the s&p 500 or oil prices.

the new venture will compete directly with goldman's platform, which launched in 2015 and sells notes through broker networks such as raymond james financial inc . and lpl financial holdings inc .

the goal of luma, simon and a handful of startups is to replace expensive human sales forces and lay cheaper digital pipes to the retail investors who buy structured notes.

mr. bonacci compared these digital middlemen to clearing firms and stock exchanges, with the field winnowing over time.

80,2018-07-17,"rising interest rates and a massive tax cut carried bank of america corp. to a 33% increase in second-quarter profit, making it the latest big bank to benefit from strong economic conditions.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c.-based bank, the second-largest in the u.s. by assets, rose to $6.784 billion from $5.106 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 63 cents. analysts had expected 57 cents a share. revenue fell to $22.609 billion from $22.829 billion a year earlier, when the bank posted a one-time gain related to the sale of a business. without that gain, revenue would have risen 3%.the results marked another quarter during which chief executive brian moynihan led the bank to solid earnings growth after several rocky years after his tenure began in 2010. the bank's strong results in recent quarters are another sign that many big banks are back in growth mode a decade out from a financial crisis that threatened their existence.

on friday, jpmorgan chase & co. and citigroup inc. posted double-digit profit increases for the second quarter. wells fargo & co. stumbled due to a number of one-time charges that dinged earnings as well as a shrinking loan book and lower fees in several of its main businesses.

bank of america's earnings were ""almost all you could have hoped for,"" wrote glenn schorr, a bank analyst at evercore isi. loans grew by 2% from a year earlier, while deposits rose nearly 4%. the lender also cut expenses by 5%. trading revenue, excluding an accounting adjustment, rose nearly 7% to $3.596 billion from $3.369 billion in the second quarter of last year.

one weak spot was investment-banking fees, which fell 7% from a year earlier.

bank of america shares rose 4.3% monday, putting them in positive territory for 2018.

rising interest rates provided a major lift. lenders such as bank of america turn a profit on the difference between what they pay on deposits and the rate they collect on loans. in the quarter, the federal reserve raised its benchmark rate for a seventh time in three years.

banks have been able to pocket most of the benefits from the rate increases because customers aren't broadly demanding more interest on their deposits. overall, bank of america paid a rate of 0.38% on u.s. interest-bearing deposits in the second quarter, compared with 0.30% in the first quarter. in its retail-banking unit, the bank paid a minuscule 0.05%.

banks are expected to eventually have to pay more interest to keep depositors around, crimping the financial benefit of future rate increases. bank of america has managed to keep interest costs in check better than many of its rivals, giving it more room to maneuver should consumers begin to demand higher rates.

the recent tax-law changes also provided a major lift. the bank paid $1.71 billion in income tax in the quarter, down 43% from $3.015 billion in the same quarter last year, before the legislation was passed.

the question is whether the good results help change investors' sentiment about bank stocks. after a huge run-up after the 2016 election, investors have shown little enthusiasm for the industry's shares this year. since the start of 2018, the kbwnasdaq bank index is roughly flat and trails broader u.s. stock-market benchmarks.

investors have grown wary of lenders, analysts say, because of a flattening of the yield curve: a narrowing of the difference in the yields of shorter- and longer-term treasurys.

a flatter yield curve can be bad for banks because they earn less on loans and securities tied to longer-term treasurys. the narrowing also potentially signals problems ahead for the economy.

""it will have an impact,"" bank of america chief financial officer paul donofrio said of the yield curve on a monday call with reporters. however, like many lenders, the bank is more sensitive to shorter-term rates than longer-term ones, which limits the pain from the current curve, he said.

81,2018-07-16,"a decade after the financial crisis, the wall street journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. today, we spotlight ex-merrill lynch ceo stanley o'neal.

stanley o'neal left merrill lynch & co . in shambles, and his career hasn't been the same ever since.the former merrill chief executive, known for his abrasive management style and his aggressive transformation of the storied brokerage firm, hasn't held a corner-office job since he was forced to resign in 2007.

while some of the top wall street executives who steered their firms through the chaos of the financial crisis have been able to embark on second acts at the top of new companies, mr. o'neal has kept a lower profile since his tumultuous tenure at merrill. he has limited his jobs to board-of-directors roles, including at aerospace-parts specialist arconic inc. and chemicals firm platform specialty products corp .

several longtime merrill veterans continue to lay the firm's demise as an independent, stand-alone company at the feet of mr. o'neal. over his five-year tenure as ceo, mr. o'neal pressed the brokerage to let go of its long-embraced mother merrill image, so called because many at the firm felt it adopted a maternal nature toward its clients and employees.

instead, mr. o'neal pursued a more performance-driven organization that put greater emphasis on riskier bets, such as accumulating subprime mortgage assets, and less on selling stocks and bonds.

the makeover brought in big profits and raised the profile of mr. o'neal, who was also the first black ceo of a major wall street firm. he helped turn merrill into the no. 1 stockbrokerage firm in the u.s. at the time.

but mr. o'neal's effort to move away from a decades-old culture caused an exodus of talent to rivals such as goldman sachs group inc . and morgan stanley . brutal shake-ups of top-executive positions weren't uncommon.

his massive foray into subprime mortgages turned toxic, and in 2007, merrill was forced to take a multibillion-dollar write-down on those assets. mr. o'neal's tenure would last another week before merrill's board intervened.

he was unceremoniously replaced with john thain , then the head of nyse euronext . mr. thain tried to repair the firm's balance sheet, but mortgage-related losses continued to mount, forcing merrill's executives into a last-ditch effort to save the firm's legacy: a $50 billion acquisition by bank of america corp . in 2009.

""they allowed short-term profitability to blind their views of the highly leveraged and risky business merrill would become, and they allowed a small group of greedy individuals to destroy an icon,"" wrote winthrop h. smith jr ., a former merrill executive whose father helped build the firm, in a self-published history about the company.

82,2018-07-09,"u.s. companies are buying back record amounts of stock this year, but their shares aren't getting the boost they bargained for.

s&p 500 companies are on track to repurchase as much as $800 billion in stock this year, a record that would eclipse 2007's buyback bonanza. among the biggest buyers are companies like oracle corp., bank of america corp. and jpmorgan chase & co.but 57% of the more than 350 companies in the s&p 500 that bought back shares this year are trailing the index's 3.2% increase. that is the highest percentage of companies to fall short of the benchmark's gain since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, according to a wall street journal analysis of share buyback and performance data from factset.

the historic spending spree on share buybacks has some analysts worried companies are buying their shares at excessive valuations during the peak of the economic cycle and at a time the market rally is nine years old. others warn the billions of dollars spent to buy back shares could have gone toward capital improvements like new factories or technology that could lead to stronger long-term growth.

""there has been less of a reward for companies engaging in new buybacks over the last 18 months,"" said kate moore, chief equity strategist and a managing director at asset-management firm blackrock inc. ""it's fair for investors to ask whether companies are buying at the right point.""

the s&p 500 buyback index, which tracks the share performance of the 100 biggest stock repurchasers, has gained just 1.3% this year, well underperforming the s&p 500.

share buybacks have become corporate america's go-to strategy for boosting stock prices and earnings over the past 30 years. the point of buybacks is to try to make a company's stock more valuable. by mopping up shares, a company shrinks the stock pie, which boosts earnings per share. that, in turn, should push the share price higher.

the potential problem: executives directing buybacks are essentially timing the market and often they end up buying high.

buyback activity reached a frenzy in the early 2000s; the previous record for share repurchases was $589.1 billion in 2007. but that was just a year before the stock market tumbled into the worst financial crisis since the great depression. the result: companies like exxon mobil corp., microsoft corp. and international business machine corp. each paid more than $18 billion to repurchase stock at a peak, only to see their share prices slump a year later.

stock buybacks appear just as ill-timed now, some analysts and investors said, especially as companies ramp up spending after last year's $1.5 trillion tax overhaul put extra cash in their coffers.

oracle has been one of the biggest buyers of its own stock in recent years and spent $11.8 billion on stock repurchases last year, when shares gained nearly 23%. but that gamble hasn't looked smart this year as the networking-device maker has struggled alongside the broader market, pulling its shares down 6%.

still, oracle's board approved a fresh round of share buybacks totaling $12 billion in february, and executives appear to have spent nearly half that sum already. a representative from oracle declined to comment on its share-buyback program, but the company said in a recent securities and exchange commission filing that it ""cannot guarantee"" its share repurchase ""will enhance long-term stockholder value.""

others like mcdonald's corp., bank of america and jpmorgan chase have spent billions on share repurchases this year but haven't seen a short-term bounce in share prices. mcdonald's bought back $1.6 billion of shares in the first quarter, but the fast-food chain's stock is down 7.4% this year. bank of america and jpmorgan chase have both spent more than $4.5 billion to buy back their shares, which are down 5% and 2.7%, respectively.

all three companies also spent multibillion-dollar sums on buybacks in 2017 as the stock market hit repeated highs.

companies in the s&p 500 that have repurchased shares are expected to see a return on investment of about 6.4% this year, a percentage that falls below the past six rolling five-year periods as measured by fortuna advisors, a financial consulting firm that has examined buyback trends going back to 2007.

returns on investment for buybacks peaked in 2013, according to fortuna's analysis, as companies used share repurchases to boost earnings and dig themselves out of the depths of the financial crisis. with stock prices relatively low at the time and economic activity tepid, share buybacks were one of companies' key sources of earnings growth.

but even as the stock market steadied in the subsequent years and economic growth around the world picked up to help boost profits, corporate executives continued to spend wildly on share repurchases -- often at the expense of other types of spending, including dividends and capital improvements. spending on capital expenditures rose to $166 billion in the first quarter, up 24% from a year earlier, according to credit suisse, but still well below the $189 billion spent on buybacks.

""the majority of capital deployed is going right back to shareholders and not reinvestment in businesses,"" said gregory milano, chief executive at fortuna. ""if that's the only thing you're relying on, it's going to end badly.""

some share buybacks do pay off, but that tends to be among companies that show a high level of sales and earnings growth on their own, analysts said. apple inc., for example, has bought back $22.8 billion worth of stock this year. its shares have risen 11%, with much of the boost coming after it reported strong gains in second-fiscal-quarter revenue and profit -- as well as a record $100 billion plan to buy back more stock.

83,2018-06-20,"bank of america doesn't want employees to worry that its new virtual assistant, erica, will change or eliminate their jobs. it wants them to prepare for that to happen.

erica made its debut this year as one of bank of america's highest-profile efforts to use artificial intelligence. responding either to speech or text commands, erica helps customers perform basic banking tasks, like locking a missing debit card or finding routing numbers.but while the virtual assistant -- the first to be offered in a large u.s. lender's app -- is intended to bolster the customer experience, such innovations pose a threat to existing jobs. to help workers cope, bank of america recently launched a set of online courses to train them for new and evolving roles in the company.

about three years ago, chief operations and technology officer cathy bessant realized that technological changes were fundamentally transforming the nearly 95,000 jobs in her unit, she says. her division consists of staffers who build and run the digital tools that underpin the bank, as well as employees in call centers and loan processing. some of those jobs will go away, ms. bessant says, while for others, new roles and responsibilities will emerge.

across the banking industry, 1.2 million jobs are expected to be affected by ai technologies like erica, according to a 2018 report by autonomous research. such tools will allow many employees to do their jobs more efficiently, the report says. but thousands of others will find their roles eliminated.

technology has already changed the nature of work in the banking industry. many customers, for instance, now perform routine tasks themselves, such as depositing checks digitally instead of visiting a branch. in response, bank of america and others have minimized the role of tellers and boosted sales staff in branches. ai is expected to continue to affect customer-service roles such as tellers, the autonomous report says.

ms. bessant believes cheap, high-speed computing power means technological change in the industry has now escalated to a pace rivaling the industrial revolution. tasks that involve ""routinizable skills that don't add customer or company value"" will be automated, she says, and tools like erica will allow customers to get help quickly without a human intermediary.

the charlotte, n.c.-based bank already has cut the number of employees across the bank to 209,000 at the end of 2017 from 282,000 at the end of 2011. going forward, ms. bessant doesn't think the number of employees in her unit will necessarily decline further. instead, she says, the nature of those jobs will change. while some roles will be automated, new jobs will be created to analyze and oversee the automated processes.

the new online courses -- dubbed gt&o university -- are part of an effort to make the transition go as smoothly as possible. the online training, which was rolled out in late april, grew out of the bank's desire to train employees for those new jobs and the ""very real and day-to-day need for people to stay motivated about working here,"" ms. bessant says. the courses are available to workers in ms. bessant's global tech and operations unit. employees can choose from classes in four ""colleges"" encompassing basic banking skills, technology, operations and leadership.

within each college, employees can pick different topics and sit through beginner, intermediate and advanced training. the topics currently have about 20 to 30 hours of content each, and include ai and various coding languages.

there are also courses on the bank's efficiency initiative known as ""operational excellence."" in these popular classes, employees learn to document and measure clients' experiences, for example.

the courses are optional, but the bank says they have already been taken more than 20,000 times. the bank says course completions in relevant subjects are starting to become a factor in internal job applications.

when asked how many of the roles in her unit will change in coming years, ms. bessant says: ""100%. including, by the way, mine.""

84,2018-06-18,"a decade after the financial crisis, the wall street journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. today, we spotlight former countrywide ceo angelo mozilo.

angelo mozilo is regarded by many as one of the chief villains of the housing crisis. but the former head of lender countrywide financial corp. said he and his company had nothing to do with it.in interviews with the wall street journal -- among the few he has given since he lost control of his company a decade ago -- he said the liquidity crunch and the ensuing financial panic were primary causes of the financial crisis.

""not subprime mortgages, not countrywide, not angelo mozilo,"" said mr. mozilo, who turns 80 this year. ""i wish i had that kind of power.""

mr. mozilo, the son of a bronx butcher, co-founded countrywide in 1969 as a two-man shop. over the decades, he built into the largest mortgage lender in the u.s.

but when the housing crisis hit in 2008, mr. mozilo and his company faced a reckoning.

countrywide had long cultivated a reputation as a savvy lender that made it through housing downturns. by the mid-2000s, though, the firm embraced the race-to-the-bottom mortgage-lending mania and delved into riskier loans.

amid surging delinquencies and a plummeting stock, mr. mozilo unloaded his company in a fire sale to bank of america corp. that deal in 2008 haunted bank of america for years, causing billions of dollars worth of legal settlements and loan losses.

""that was a star-crossed deal -- all the stars aligned to a bad result,"" said nancy bush, an independent bank analyst.

ms. bush said the mortgage industry ""just kind of lost its mind"" during the housing boom of the early 2000s. ""it wasn't just countrywide, but countrywide was taking shortcuts everywhere,"" she said. ""they weren't picky about quality. and everybody bought into this hook, line and sinker at exactly the wrong time.""

the sale didn't get mr. mozilo off the hook for countrywide's behavior, though. in 2009, the u.s. government accused him of dumping $140 million worth of stock based on insider information about countrywide's deterioration, making him a walking symbol of the excesses that led to the financial crisis. in 2006, when the housing market was cresting, mr. mozilo was paid $51.8 million, much of it in the form of stock options, according to a regulatory filing.

despite that, mr. mozilo sees himself through the lens of his precrisis reputation, when he was viewed as one of the most successful and innovative financial executives. he has talked previously about how countrywide used non-traditional forms of credit, such as telephone bills or grocers' bills, to make loans to farmers and minority borrowers, and he has expressed concern that many potential homeowners are being shut out of the lending market because they don't fit the mold of a traditional borrower.

85,2018-06-16,"merrill lynch is considering a reversal of its ban on commissions in retirement accounts the firm manages, marking a potentially significant retreat for a leading advocate of fee-based accounts.

the brokerage arm of bank of america corp . banned commissions for retirement accounts in anticipation of the labor department's ""fiduciary rule,"" which went into effect in april 2016. the regulation was meant to protect retirement savers from conflicted financial advice from brokers seeking commission income.but the rule was thrown out by a u.s. appeals court in march. and the securities and exchange commission is working on its own version of a best-interest rule that would apply to brokers.

that has led merrill to review its policy, setting the stage for a potential about-face on aggressive changes it had said were in the best interest of clients.

""while we'll remain a standard-bearer on  front, we'd be remiss if we didn't consider additional flexibility and choice we can provide to clients,"" said andy sieg , head of merrill lynch wealth management.

some financial firms fought the regulation and held off on making big changes because of it, but merrill in 2016 launched a media campaign advertising its new policy and commitment to clients' best interest. the firm said charging fees as a percentage of assets, instead of commissions on trades, is the best way to ensure retirement nest eggs are protected, what it called ""a simple, open way to work that is intended to address these conflicts.""

clients have been frustrated by the commission ban, said a person familiar with merrill's decision. for retirement clients with traditional brokerage accounts, the posture meant either converting to a fee-based account, moving to the bank's cheaper online offering, merrill edge, or leaving the firm.

some clients opted to leave merrill, brokers say, because fees that typically amount to roughly 1% of assets were costlier in some cases than commissions. some brokers felt the shift left them at a competitive disadvantage because rivals continued to allow commission-based accounts.

the review is expected to last about 60 days. potential changes center around relaxing restrictions on stock and bond transactions and private-equity investments in retirement accounts, said a person involved with the review. ""when that's in your best interest, we're not going to tell you that you can't,"" the person said.

merrill's embrace of the fiduciary rule came in contrast to many other firms across the industry that criticized the regulation for restricting client choice. and competitors didn't follow after merrill lynch announced it was scrapping commissions in retirement accounts.

brokers at merrill welcomed the firm's review of its policy. ""you have to be able to compete,"" said one seasoned adviser, referring to rivals' ability to continue offering brokerage services, like one-time stock transactions, to clients with retirement money.

some expressed frustration and lamented lost clients, even if they appreciate that merrill has signaled it may walk back the commission ban. ""they jumped the gun,"" one broker said, adding that it is potentially embarrassing and confusing to communicate a reversal to clients who were recently told they needed to convert to a fee-based account because it was in their best interest.

consumer advocates said the development is a potentially positive one. ""if investors who are better off in a commission account have access to one, then that's beneficial,"" said barbara rober, director of investor protection at the consumer federation of america. ""we never felt a transition to fee accounts was necessary to comply"" with the rule, she said.

for merrill and others across the brokerage industry, the fiduciary rule helped speed up a shift to fee-paying advisory accounts from traditional brokerage accounts that has been under way for years. executives like the steady -- and often higher -- stream of fees such accounts generate, and many say they better jibe with a fiduciary model that puts clients' interests first and minimizes conflicts of interest.

the shift has helped brokerages better compete with low-cost automated advisers and brokers-turned-independent advisers, which typically charge fees and have for decades been required to put clients' interests before their own.",Document J000000020180616ee6g0002w
86,2018-06-13,"washington -- bank of america merrill lynch will pay $15.7 million to settle claims that its traders lied about how much they paid to acquire mortgage bonds, allowing the bank to charge a higher price to clients buying securities.

the sanction includes $10.5 million that must be returned to customers and a $5.2 million civil penalty, the securities and exchange commission said tuesday. in some cases, the sec said, merrill's traders also failed to disclose that their markups ""bore no reasonable relationship to the prevailing market prices.""the bank neither admitted nor denied the sec's claims.

the settlement is the latest example of the government's battle with wall street over brokers accused of lying about the prices they paid to obtain bonds. a u.s. appeals court last month tossed out the conviction of former jefferies group llc trader jesse litvak, who was accused of cheating customers out of $2 million by inflating prices he said he paid for residential mortgage-backed bonds.

mr. litvak's long-running criminal case became a symbol of a government crackdown on wall street practices and led to changes at many dealers, from mandatory training to heightened surveillance of traders. but the justice department found it difficult to convince juries that lying by bond dealers was a crime. mr. litvak's attorneys compared his techniques with those of used-car salesmen, whose tendency to bluff is well recognized by customers.

on the same day that mr. litvak prevailed, a federal jury in connecticut acquitted david demos, a former managing director at cantor fitzgerald & co. mr. demos also had been accused of overstating prices he paid to coax clients to pay him more.

in the civil case that the sec settled tuesday, the regulator accused merrill's traders of similar conduct, sometimes inflating or deflating what they paid by significant amounts.

in one example cited by the sec, a merrill trader allegedly misled a bond seller about how much another bank client was willing to pay for the bond.

the maneuver allowed merrill to get the bond for a lower price from the seller and immediately unload about $15 million of it at a profit of $386,042, the sec said.

the sec also said merrill lynch failed to supervise the accused traders because the bank's policies weren't reasonably designed to prevent or detect the wrongdoing. the allegations covered a period from 2009 to 2012.

a spokesman for the bank said merrill has improved its procedures since that time and addressed the problems raised by regulators.",Document J000000020180613ee6d0002a
87,2018-06-09,"the banking industry has a new partner in washington: a top federal regulator, joseph otting.

sworn in as comptroller of the currency in november, mr. otting is the first banker in decades to run the obscure but powerful comptroller's office, or occ. the office oversees huge banks such as bank of america corp. and u.s. bancorp, two of his former employers. his resume also includes a stint working alongside steven mnuchin, now the treasury secretary, atop a bank whose foreclosure record has made it a lightning rod.his arrival represents the latest change in washington's relationship with bankers, which has swung from hands-off regulation in the years leading up to the 2008 bank bailouts to aggressive and sometimes antagonistic in the following years.

seven months into his tenure, mr. otting is pushing to rewrite expensive requirements for banks to have anti-money laundering and community-development programs. he is encouraging them to expand businesses that had been constrained by regulators, including loans to companies deep in debt, and small-dollar loans.

he is just one financial regulator appointed by president donald trump who is flipping the script from the obama era. mick mulvaney, acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau, has been openly hostile to his predecessor's approach to enforcing consumer laws. federal reserve vice chairman for supervision randal quarles has begun to temper his agency's stance on big bank rules.

""the tempo in the regulatory community is different,"" mr. otting told a securitization conference in march. ""i think it is more of a partnership with the banks as opposed to a dictatorial perspective under the prior administration.""

mr. otting, who declined to be interviewed for this article, will get a chance to explain his approach in more detail next week when he testifies before congress for the first time since taking office.

for now, bankers are pleased with the more conciliatory approach. ""it has really been a breath of fresh air to have you here,"" american bankers association president rob nichols told mr. otting at another conference in april.

to others, regulators calling banks partners is cause for alarm. the idea that banks and markets will regulate themselves, critics say, was a cause of the financial crisis and the subsequent bailouts of big banks.

sen. sherrod brown , the top democrat on the senate banking committee, gave a speech tuesday accusing mr. otting and other trump-nominated regulators of bowing to bank lobbyists ""trying to undo the rules we put in place to protect taxpayers and consumers.""

the occ, and mr. otting, are central to this debate. congress created the comptroller's office in the 1860s to standardize currency and watch over bankers. now it focuses on oversight, sharing the job with the fed and other agencies.

president barack obama's comptroller, thomas curry, spent his career regulating banks. after he took office in 2012, lawmakers at congressional hearings grilled him over long-held concerns the occ was too close to the industry.

mr. curry, who declined to comment, made changing that perception the central goal of his tenure. mr. otting is now reversing a number of his predecessor's initiatives.

mr. curry discouraged banks from making high-interest, small-dollar loans he judged could hurt borrowers.

mr. otting is encouraging banks to return to such lending so consumers have more choices.

under mr. curry, the occ enforced prescriptive standards for leveraged lending, a form of financing for already-indebted companies.

as a banker, mr. otting helped companies obtain leveraged loans. he has compared mr. curry's leveraged-lending stance to the ""wrath of khan.""

by the time mr. curry left office in may 2017, most major banks were in the regulatory penalty box for lax anti-money laundering programs.

speaking to the bankers association, mr. otting lamented how much anti-money-laundering paperwork ""we file as an industry"" and said he is pushing to make the rules more efficient.

one of mr. curry's final acts was downgrading wells fargo & co.'s rating under the community reinvestment act, a law governing how banks serve low-income communities.

one of mr. otting's first acts was to elevate rewriting cra rules to the top of the occ's agenda.

mr. otting grew up in iowa and got his first exposure to the lending business working at a car dealership his father operated. he entered a bank of america training program and built a career serving corporate clients for union bank and later u.s. bancorp, where he rose to vice chair running commercial banking on the west coast.

friends and former colleagues attribute mr. otting's success to interpersonal skills and detail-oriented management. he engages even low-level subordinates and has an exceptional recall of names and birthdays, they said.

in 2010, mr. mnuchin recruited him to onewest bank. they sold the bank to cit group inc. for $3.4 billion in 2015, but stayed in touch. when mr. mnuchin became treasury secretary in 2017, he pushed for mr. otting to get the occ job.

onewest has settled multiple accusations of abusive foreclosure practices occurring during their tenure. the two men say onewest did a better job than peers after inheriting a pile of toxic mortgages.

mr. otting has sometimes tripped in adjusting to the washington spotlight. while his nomination was under review, he bought stock in some of the banks he was preparing to oversee -- a permitted move some ethics experts questioned.

weeks after taking the job, mr. otting turned heads inside the occ by asking staff about acquiring a license to carry a firearm in the nation's capital, according to a person familiar with the matter. he is licensed to carry in nevada; an occ spokesman confirmed he made the inquiry and says he isn't seeking to carry a gun on the job.

beyond policy toward banks, mr. otting is also changing the occ.

mr. curry took decision-making power away from bank examiners outside washington and sought to move their desks out of bank offices -- an effort to reduce the perception of the occ being captured by industry.

mr. otting ceased the examiner relocations and says he has cut in half the number of documents requiring his approval, reducing the review time for regulatory decisions and empowering lower-level examiners.

the agency, he said at an april conference, needs to improve ""our responsiveness to our customer, which are the banks.""

88,2018-05-25,"some merrill lynch brokers are bracing for a pay cut this summer as the firm's parent, bank of america corp ., rolls out a new compensation program that punishes advisers who don't meet certain sales targets.

the plan is stirring some discord inside merrill, in part because it emphasizes cross-selling outside brokers' traditional role. some brokers are also complaining the plan is being applied retroactively in what amounts to a pay clawback.""it's going to be ugly,"" said one longtime merrill broker who has spent recent weeks grousing with colleagues about the changes.

bank of america unveiled the changes late last year in how its 17,000 merrill financial advisers would be paid as part of an effort to increase the unit's profit, regardless of stock-market conditions. the plan, which is also a response to a tougher competitive environment, is meant to juice brokers' assets, swell bank deposits and funnel more clients into retail-bank products such as mortgages and credit cards.

the program ""is having the desired impact,"" said andy sieg , head of merrill lynch wealth management. ""advisers are prioritizing client acquisition"" and ""making referrals to the broader bank of america at higher levels than ever before.""

that is potentially good news for the bank's shareholders, who are already enjoying a bounce in the stock from a stronger economy and higher interest rates. clients with more of their assets and liabilities spread across a big bank are potentially more lucrative and may be less likely to leave if a broker retires or jumps to a rival.

merrill and its competitors have traditionally rewarded growth instead of punishing the lack of it, analysts say. introducing a stick -- the first in recent years by one of the big firms -- reflects how traditional wall street brokerages are fighting off an increasing number of cheaper, tech-enhanced options.

investors have been flocking to automated platforms, discount brokerages and independent advisers who aren't beholden to products affiliated with a big bank.

typically, brokers at merrill and its rivals are paid a percentage of the fees and commissions they generate. advisers generating $1 million annually in revenue, the average at merrill, pocket 42% of that for themselves, or $420,000, for example. the traditional model of paying brokers can give them some latitude over how they serve clients and boost business.

under merrill lynch 's new plan, however, pay could move up or down based not just on revenue, but also based on asset and liability growth, the number of new clients the broker brings in and referrals to the bank.

if minimum sales targets aren't met, the broker generating $1 million in revenue could lose up to $10,000 from their june paycheck because they would be collecting 2 percentage points less of the revenue generated. the penalty then applies to monthly pay going forward.

if brokers hit certain higher targets, they can get up to a 2-percentage-point bump in pay, as long as they make two referrals to the parent bank. monthly pay for those brokers would increase through december, when advisers' progress hitting targets is re-evaluated.

merrill lynch declined to share an estimate on the number of brokers it expects to be affected by the pay change in july. some employees estimated it would at least be in the hundreds.

merrill told brokers in a memo wednesday that it would expand the definition of new clients to include some who already have an account with the firm's online discount brokerage platform. ""our goal is to have every single one of you hit your growth grid hurdle,"" the memo said.

mr. sieg said in an interview tuesday that he expects that the dollar impact of pay cuts will roughly be offset by the bonuses the firm gives to higher-performing advisers.

some financial advisers say the changes put too much pressure on them to push products that customers may not want. ""when they put referrals in the comp plan, that codified it for us,"" said emerson ham, an adviser who left merrill lynch in march after 26 years with the firm. ""there's a fine line between encouraging referrals and forcing them.""

89,2018-05-19,"a decade after the financial crisis, the wall street journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. today, we spotlight moody's ceo raymond mcdaniel jr. and former merrill lynch banker christopher ricciardi.

christopher ricciardi, a former merrill lynch banker, was known as the ""grandfather of cdos"" for helping popularize these complex structured products that blew up during the financial crisis.now, he is bringing his experience to another corner of the financial world with mounds of debt: student loans.

mr. ricciardi joined the andover, mass.-based investment firm flowpoint capital partners lp as a partner last year. the firm's investment strategy relies in part on buying a product known as income share agreements, or isas. under these, college students agree to give up part of their future income for a certain period in exchange for payments to cover all or part of their tuition. these products are meant to be an alternative to a student loan.

charles trafton, managing partner at flowpoint, said mr. ricciardi is helping with the creation of what they call a new asset class. mr. trafton said the firm is trying to create a market for higher education by determining the true value of a college degree, factoring in variables such as a student's school and major. students repay as much as double the amount of the tuition fronted, he said. mr. ricciardi's ""skills in helping create new asset classes and skills in securitization are really helpful,"" mr. trafton said.

mr. ricciardi was a financial pioneer who bundled asset-backed securities into pools called collateralized debt obligations, or cdos, which were then sliced into tranches of varying risk. from 2003 to 2006, he helped transform merrill from bit player to powerhouse in this lucrative business. the company leapt from 15th place among cdo-underwriting ranks in 2002 to the no. 1 spot on wall street in 2004. merrill's underwriting total soared to $35 billion in 2005, of which $14 billion were backed mostly by securities tied to subprime mortgages -- the debt whose blowup sparked the financial crisis.

mr. ricciardi the following year jumped to cohen & co . after 18 months, cohen's assets under management quadrupled to $40 billion. but the value of many of the cdos began to falter in 2007 as mortgage delinquencies rose.

mr. ricciardi, 49 years old, declined to be interviewed, though he answered some questions in writing. he said he objected to how media reports have portrayed his role during the crisis. ""sells papers i guess,"" he said in an email.

janet tavakoli , founder of tavakoli structured finance, a consulting firm that has done work on cdos, said mr. ricciardi was a key figure in ""one of several problems that led to the crisis.""

after leaving cohen in 2010, mr. ricciardi helped launch mead park management llc, a hedge fund that focused on selling collateralized loan obligations, a subset of cdos. mead park is no longer in operation; mr. ricciardi said in an email that he left in october.

in addition, he founded plaay sports, a sports-video-editing company using artificial intelligence, mr. ricciardi said in another email.",Document J000000020180519ee5j0002h

mr. weddle said he plans to begin transitioning his role to ms. pennington once her position is filled in the coming weeks. he joined edward jones in 1976 and worked as a financial adviser before eventually being named managing partner in 2006.

ms. pennington's appointment comes at a pivotal point for the brokerage industry. firms are trying to reshape advisers into full-service financial planners, as opposed to brokers who buy and sell stocks and bonds, while replenishing aging, mostly male ranks. women represent just 15.1% of financial advisers, according to research firm cerulli associates .

""being a woman in this role isn't typical,"" ms. pennington said in an interview tuesday. ""our industry is recognizing there's a tremendous pool of talent that hasn't been tapped as well as it could be.""

at the same time, given that wives tend to outlive their husbands, women are positioned to control an increasing share of a $30 trillion wealth transfer under way as baby boomers leave assets to their children. analysts estimate about 70% of the funds changing hands over the coming decades will be controlled by women.

edward jones said it is hoping to tap that market and many of those potential customers don't already have advisers.

efforts to attract and promote more women are paying off, though executives say there is a long way to go. women made up about a quarter of edward jones's new recruits at the end of last year, and the firm's top adviser in terms of assets under management is texas-based jennifer marcontell.

91,2018-05-08,"it's a good time to be a megabank.

in many businesses, the largest global banks such as jpmorgan chase & co. and bank of america corp. are getting bigger, while others are struggling to keep pace. the latest example: the volatility-induced surge in first-quarter stock-trading revenue that smaller u.s. investment banks almost universally missed out on.stifel financial corp., raymond james financial inc., evercore inc., and piper jaffray cos. all reported drops of 10% or more in stock-trading revenue for the first three months of 2018 compared with a year ago, according to company filings, resulting in the lowest market share in years for midtier trading firms.

by contrast, trading arms of the biggest u.s. banks -- at jpmorgan and bank of america, as well as at citigroup inc., goldman sachs group inc. and morgan stanley -- posted gains in equities sales and trading revenue ranging from 26% to 38% for the quarter versus a year ago.

that suggests one widely held prediction coming out of the financial crisis -- that regulation would crimp giant wall street trading desks and open opportunities for nimbler, less-regulated trading shops -- isn't holding up.

instead, the broad shift toward complex electronic trading and a decline in the number of hedge funds and active asset managers, especially smaller ones, have put pressure on the trading desks of small and midtier firms.

of course, smaller firms have notched some wins, and some are reporting record revenue, due in part to strong showings in businesses like wealth management and merger advice.

in equities trading, the overall revenue pie has shrunk from about $90 billion in 2007 to about $40 billion last year, according to research provider coalition. pricing pressure has been relentless due to factors including lightning-fast algorithmic traders.

the rise of passive index funds and exchange-traded portfolios, plus a new trend of investing directly in volatility, has put money managers who actively manage funds -- the core clients of smaller securities firms -- on the defensive. the first-quarter equity revenue surge at big banks was driven primarily by derivatives activity around volatility, not traditional stock trading.

""we would have expected to attract more activity given the bouts of volatility we experienced in the quarter,"" deb schoneman, piper jaffray's president, told analysts in april. ""however, active asset managers -- our client base -- did not participate as much.""

in an actively managed fund, portfolio managers buy and sell securities in an attempt to outperform a specific index. passively managed funds aim to match the returns from an index.

at the end of 2013, six publicly reporting midtier investment banks, including jefferies group and cowen inc., generated about 8% of u.s. banks' reported equities-trading revenue, according to company reports compiled by analysts at nomura instinet. at the beginning of this year, that share dropped to about 4%.

""in the first quarter, the volume that was occurring was from passive strategies, and those. . .tend to be more low-touch trading that the big banks have always dominated,"" said ronald kruszewski, stifel's chief executive, in an interview.

new regulations are playing a role. european authorities this year began a ban on the practice of using trading commissions to pay for stock research, part of a set of rules known as mifid ii.

now, funds investing money for european clients, even if they are trading in the u.s., may need to pay for research directly.

the upshot is that some fund managers are now more attuned to the cost and value of research and are paring back relationships. greenwich associates, an industry research firm, estimated that budgets for research have dropped by $300 million.

""the model for research is challenged across the industry right now, and has been for about a decade,"" said paul reilly, chief executive of raymond james, on a call with analysts in april. he estimated that the new rules have reduced some of his firm's commission revenue.

while raymond james had no plans to exit trading, mr. reilly said, the firm's focus has been to expand its m&a and private-markets businesses. raymond james's net revenue reached a record level, $1.8 billion, for the first three months of the year.

meanwhile, jpmorgan's chief financial officer, marianne lake, told analysts in april that the new european rules and other changes in the markets may be helping the country's largest bank by assets.

""we're gaining some share and we're benefiting from some of that concentration,"" she said.

92,2018-05-08,"washington -- the largest big-bank rule changes proposed since president donald trump took office would refashion one of the core responses to the 2008 financial crisis, generating an unusual level of opposition for the consensus-driven world of bank regulation.

trump-appointed officials are retooling the leverage ratio, a capital rule adopted to curb excessive borrowing. the changes portend more freedom for gigantic lenders such as bank of america corp. and goldman sachs group inc. to expand activities they have cut back in recent years. officials say other restrictions will still prevent the banks from taking outsize risk.capital rules seek to prevent too much risk-taking by forcing bankers to fund loans and investments with a minimum amount of investors' equity, as opposed to less-secure borrowed money.

big-bank critics across the political spectrum support the leverage ratio as a relatively simple curb. bankers say the current version is so strict and simplistic that it discourages them from low-risk activities.

regulators are siding with the industry and recently proposed two major changes that would diminish its significance.

""that's going to allow us to have more flexibility,"" bank of america chief financial officer paul donofrio said on an april 16 call with wall street analysts.

he was referring to a joint proposal by the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency to lower the leverage ratio for the largest u.s. banks. with the changes, the bank could expand some business lines or potentially return more profits to shareholders, he said. the fed has separately proposed cutting back the leverage ratio's role in its annual ""stress tests"" of big banks.

the proposals are among the first in a series of expected changes to postcrisis regulatory policies erected by the obama administration. trump-appointed regulators also are rewriting the volcker rule trading ban and revisiting bank liquidity rules.

opposition, particularly to the joint fed-occ proposal, is coming from both conservatives and liberals.

""we haven't had a recession since 2008, so from one point of view, our 'too-big-to-fail' banks have never really been tested,"" sen. john kennedy  told fed vice chairman for supervision randal quarles at an april 19 senate banking committee hearing. echoing democrats on the panel, mr. kennedy cautioned against ""fooling with the leverage ratio until we see how our banks do in a real, full-blown recession.""

fed governor lael brainard's april vote against the fed-occ leverage-ratio proposal is the only dissent among 315 fed board votes on record since 2012. the obama appointee said in a recent speech that banks are profitable and her colleagues should be worried about loosening capital rules.

mr. quarles, a trump appointee who backed the proposals, on friday said ""these new rules will maintain the resiliency of the financial system and make our regulation simpler and more risk sensitive.""

94,2018-04-23,"trading desks at the largest banks have started off the year on a high note.

the five u.s. banks with large trading desks finished reporting their first-quarter financial results last week, and one of the star performers was equities desks. those units -- where individual stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds are bought and sold -- saw double-digit percentage revenue increases, helped by volatility in the markets so far this year.in a numerical stroke of serendipity for the banks, equities trading revenue rose 38% at three separate institutions: goldman sachs group, bank of america corp. and citigroup inc. the same metric at morgan stanley rose 27% and at jpmorgan chase & co. rose 26%.

in fixed-income divisions, which are typically larger than equities businesses, trading performance was mixed.

at goldman sachs, fixed income, currencies and commodities trading revenue rose 23% off a disappointing 2017 first quarter result. at morgan stanley, fixed-income trading climbed 9% and at jpmorgan, it rose 8%. trading fell 13% at bank of america and 7% at citigroup.

95,2018-04-20,"big banks posted strong and rising returns on equity in the first quarter, some as high as 15% -- potentially a long-awaited sign that they are finally able to focus on growth again, after the postfinancial-crisis years.

so have the banks finally turned the corner? not so fast.while the banks' first-quarter roes were strong, a significant chunk of the strength stemmed not from growth in the banks' operations, but from the sharply lower tax rates they are now enjoying because of the federal tax overhaul enacted in december, according to an analysis by the wall street journal.

the top six banks in the u.s. by assets -- jpmorgan chase & co., wells fargo & co., bank of america corp., citigroup inc., goldman sachs group inc. and morgan stanley -- reported an average return on equity of 13% in the first quarter, up from an average 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017. but that 13% would have been 11.8% without the earnings boost of more than $2.8 billion the six banks collectively received because of the decline in their tax rates from a year ago, driven by the new tax law.

wells fargo's roe would have fallen year over year, not risen, if not for the tax-related boost. and bofa and citigroup would have seen sharply lower growth in their returns.

to be sure, an increase to the adjusted 11.8% from 10.1% is still solid, with many of the banks now well above the 10% level that many investors consider to be a key inflection point.

the journal's analysis calculated what each bank's results for the latest first quarter would have been if the effective tax rate from last year's first quarter was still in effect. the banks' effective tax rates fell drastically in the first quarter compared with a year ago because of the new law's reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from the previous 35%, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars off each bank's bottom line and lowering their roes.

wells fargo, for instance, had an 18.8% effective tax rate in the latest quarter, compared with 27.5% a year ago, and its earnings would have been about $636 million lower at the old rate. the bank posted a 12.4% return on equity in the latest quarter, but without that $636 million, its roe would have been 10.9% -- down from the 12% roe that it posted in the first quarter of 2017, instead of rising.

bank of america's effective tax rate fell to 17.6% in the latest quarter from 27.1% a year ago, and that made a $798 million difference in its earnings. stripping out that $798 million would have lowered its latest first-quarter roe to 9.5% from the reported 10.85%, compared with 8.1% reported a year ago.

citigroup's roe would have been 8.7% without the tax boost, compared to 9.7% with it. jpmorgan's would have been 14% instead of 14.8%, goldman's would have been 14.3% instead of 15.4%, and morgan stanley's would have been 13.3% instead of 14.9%.

none of the banks provided a comment in response to the journal's analysis.

96,2018-04-19,"your next salary offer might look nothing like your current pay.

big companies such as amazon.com inc., bank of america corp. and wells fargo & co. say they have instructed recruiters not to ask about salary or benefits a candidate received in other positions, as more employers shift away from using past wages as a guide for setting their future pay.the move stems from many new laws around the u.s. aimed at closing wage gaps in the workforce. the theory behind the laws is that using past salaries to benchmark future pay can perpetuate unfairly high or low wages that workers carry from job to job.

new york city and massachusetts passed rules in 2016 banning employers in those regions from pressing job seekers to disclose salary history. since then, more than a dozen other cities and states have followed with their own wage-setting and wage-inquiry rules for employers, including california, new jersey, new orleans and pittsburgh.

proponents of the new laws say withholding information about past wages encourages employers to judge the value of a job, rather than the applicant. the companies say providing candidates with a salary range based on factors such as skills and experience can help correct inconsistencies in how different employees, including women and people of color, were valued in another role or setting.

""these new laws have created a great opportunity for employers to do some self-reflection,"" said cheryl pinarchick, a partner at fisher & phillips llp and co-chair of the law firm's pay-equity practice. many are thinking about whether they can justify differences in the salaries that their current workers earn, she said.

at the end of march, bank of america required recruiters to drop salary-history questions from the application process across the company. hundreds of hiring managers have been trained in the past year to focus pay negotiations on the salary ranges established by the bank for each job, said spokesman andy aldridge.

""we want to be a great place to work, and that includes how we approach things like pay equity,"" he said, adding that bank of america conducts annual reviews of its roughly 208,000 employees to ensure they are paid fairly for performance.

pay disparities for workers often persist when people are hired at lower salaries early in their career and then that compensation becomes the root of future salary negotiations.

the philadelphia chamber of commerce sued to halt the rollout of philadelphia's salary-history ban, which was scheduled to take effect last spring, arguing the ordinance infringed upon businesses' free-speech rights. the group expressed concern that a blanket restriction could create problems, such as not knowing how rich a salary it would take to lure a high-level executive from her current employer. the rule's implementation has been temporarily suspended until a final decision is made.

payscale, a compensation software company, in 2017 surveyed more than 15,000 job applicants from april to june to examine how the absence of pay-history information affects offers. the results surprisedlydia frank, a payscale vice president, because they contradict the advice she usually gives job applicants to withhold salary history when discussing pay.

when women were asked about past wages but declined to share the figure, they were offered 1.8% less than women who disclosed their salary history, payscale found. but men who declined to disclose previous compensation received 1.2% higher offers than men who provided the information.

offering a woman less for refusing to share pay information might reflect an unconscious bias against those who negotiate, ms. frank said, adding that the research shows it is important to stop using salary history as a guide for future pay.

pay gaps can be exacerbated by differences in how hiring managers and job seekers approach salary negotiations. men are typically more willing to negotiate salaries -- and more richly rewarded for doing so -- while some women get penalized for appearing overly aggressive, according to a growing body of economic and management research, including studies published by the harvard kennedy school and georgetown university mcdonough school of business.

the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit last week determined that businesses may be held liable for discrepancies in their workers' pay even if the imbalance stems from a previous employer, adding pressure to correct pay gaps based on gender, race or other nonperformance-related factors.

""we've seen a lot of clients adopting the spirit of law, understanding bans on salary-history inquiries are about pay equity,"" said mollie mantia, director of compliance for the talent arm of automatic data processing inc., a payroll-management firm. instead, she said more employers are opting to look at a fair market value for their talent.

97,2018-04-18,"big banks just received the first installment of benefits american corporations will reap from the new federal tax law. the haul: more than $2.5 billion.

the latest gain came tuesday when goldman sachs group inc. reported first-quarter profit that rose 26% from a year earlier. this was aided by a lower corporate-tax rate that boosted earnings by about $232 million.overall, the combined earnings of goldman and the four major national banks -- jpmorgan chase & co., wells fargo & co., citigroup inc. and bank of america corp. -- increased by more than $2.5 billion in the quarter because of the lower corporate rates under the tax-overhaul law enacted in december, according to an analysis of the banks' results by the wall street journal.

that amount is only a modest-size chunk of the banks' total first-quarter earnings -- less than 10% of their combined net income applicable to common shareholders. but it comprises a major chunk of their year-over-year earnings growth.

without the tax savings resulting from the new lower corporate tax rate, wells fargo's earnings would have declined from a year ago instead of increasing, and much of the year-over-year growth at citigroup and bank of america would be gone. losing the tax bump would have cut the earnings growth of jpmorgan to 28% from 35%; for goldman, growth would have shrunk by at least one-quarter.

the $2.5 billion gain isn't the entire story. for one thing, other provisions of the tax law prompted some of the same banks and many other companies to take big charges against their earnings in the fourth quarter. from that perspective, the first-quarter boosts merely help even things out.

still, the new data suggests investors may have to look below the surface of companies' announced results to get a true sense of how their operations are performing.

""before investors get excited about the growth of earnings of these companies, they need to look at the sources of that growth,"" said ravi gomatam, an analyst at zion research group, an accounting and tax research firm. ""a good portion of that growth is likely to be from taxes.""

the big banks acknowledge the reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 21% from the previous 35%, played a role in their first-quarter earnings growth. but they also maintain their operations are solid and growing.

bank of america's earnings growth was ""driven not only by tax reform but also operating leverage and continued strong asset quality,"" chief financial officer paul donofrio said monday on the bank's first-quarter earnings call.

michael corbat, citigroup's chief executive, said friday that ""a lower tax rate"" was a contributing factor to the bank's results along with ""strong business performance.""

marianne lake, jpmorgan's cfo, acknowledged the ""tailwind"" of the tax overhaul, but said the bank's results also benefited from ""broad-based strength.""

the journal's analysis calculated what each bank's results for the latest first quarter would have been if the effective tax rate from last year's first quarter was still in effect.

each bank's tax rate has declined dramatically since then. wells fargo, for instance, had an 18.8% effective tax rate in the latest first quarter, down from 27.5% in the year-ago quarter.

applying a 27.5% effective tax rate to the latest quarter's pretax income would have shaved about $636 million off earnings, cutting wells fargo's diluted earnings per share to 99 cents from the actual $1.12. 

citigroup, which had a 23.7% effective tax rate this quarter, would have seen about $452 million cut off its first-quarter earnings if its year-ago 31.1% effective tax rate had been in effect. that would have eliminated most of its roughly $530 million in net-income growth from a year ago.

the tax overhaul added about $798 million to bank of america's growth in net income. at jpmorgan, it added about $470 million to its earnings.

zion research's mr. gomatam notes not all companies will see the kind of tax-rate reductions the big banks did, and some tax savings could go to a company's customers or employees rather than profits. investors ""need to see that all of the tax savings are falling to the bottom line.""

investors may have looked through the numbers and realized that much of the banks' earnings growth came from a tax cut, not from operations. since announcing earnings, wells fargo shares have fallen 4%, jpmorgan's have slipped 2.8% and citigroup's have lost 3.3%.

98,2018-04-17,"bank of america corp. said monday that a boost from the u.s. tax law and rising interest rates helped first-quarter profit rise 30%, extending the string of better-than-expected results from the nation's biggest banks.

quarterly profit at the charlotte, n.c.-based bank rose to $6.92 billion from $5.34 billion a year earlier. per-share earnings were 62 cents; analysts had expected 59 cents. revenue came in at $23.13 billion, up from $22.25 billion a year earlier. analysts had expected $23.06 billion.this quarter is the first time investors have a chance to see exactly how much the recent tax law is helping the bank's bottom line. the banking industry was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower corporate tax rate. while it led to big one-time charges last quarter, the lower rate is starting to lift bank earnings this quarter. much of that is already in analysts' estimates for the bank's future profit, however. and some of the expected secondary benefits of the tax bill, such as invigorated loan growth, have yet to materialize across the industry.

bank of america said its effective tax rate fell by 9 percentage points because of the bill. in the quarter, the bank paid $1.48 billion in income taxes, compared with $1.98 billion a year earlier.

the tax benefits notwithstanding, the bank's underlying performance also was strong. income before taxes -- a way to look at the bank's performance without the tax boost -- increased about 15% to $8.39 billion from $7.32 billion a year earlier.

those factors meant a key profitability metric, return on equity, reached a milestone. the figure rose to 10.85%, above the bank's theoretical 10% cost of capital. that only happened once before in chief executive brian moynihan's eight-year tenure, in 2011 when unusual one-time factors inflated the figure. other than that, the bank last passed 10% in 2007, right before its financial state rapidly deteriorated during the financial crisis.

the first quarter was ""a solid business environment with good economic metrics. and we continue to get our fair share in that environment,"" mr. moynihan said on a call with analysts.

the results reflected the bank's yearslong strategy of boosting profits by cutting expenses, focusing on lower-risk plain-vanilla banking services and putting crisis-era headaches in the past.

rising interest rates have helped. higher rates are typically good for banks because they turn a profit on the difference between what they pay on deposits and the rate they collect on loans. in the quarter, the federal reserve raised its benchmark rate for a sixth time. bank of america said its net interest income, or profit from interest, rose about 5% from a year earlier.

banks have been able to pocket much of the benefit from the rate increases because customers aren't demanding more interest. the rate bank of america paid on u.s. interest-bearing deposits was 0.30%, only a slight rise from 0.27% in the prior quarter. still, deposits rose more than 4% from a year earlier.

loan growth, which has slowed across the industry since the 2016 presidential election, rose 3% from a year earlier at bank of america.

in the first quarter, the bank's expenses fell about 1% to $13.90 billion from $14.09 billion a year earlier. that helped push the firm's efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, below 60%, compared with 62.8% a year earlier.

the bank recently announced that plans to open branches in cities where it previously had none wouldn't elevate overall costs. the bank's total branch count, which has steadily dropped as more consumers turn to digital tools and the bank prunes less profitable locations, should be ""relatively stable from here,"" chief financial officer paul donofrio said on a call with reporters.

also, after a number of quarters of disappointing trading revenue, wild price swings for markets in the first quarter meant wall street's trading desks had a better quarter. still, results weren't much above a year earlier, which also was busy following the 2016 u.s. presidential election.

trading revenue, excluding an accounting adjustment, rose less than 1% to $4.05 billion from $4.03 billion in the first quarter of last year. equities revenue increased 38%, while revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities was down 13%.

99,2018-04-14,"a billionaire toy maker said he had submitted a bid for toys ""r"" us, even after his public crowdfunding campaign to salvage parts of the retail chain failed to gain much traction.

isaac larian, founder of bratz dolls maker mga entertainment inc., said he offered $675 million for the u.s. stores of toys ""r"" us, as well as $215 million to buy its canadian stores. toys ""r"" us is winding down its u.s. business while bankruptcy proceedings continue.in an interview, mr. larian dismissed suggestions that the bid was a publicity stunt and said bank of america corp. and ubs group ag are lining up financing for his bid. ""i'm making a cash deposit today and have a letter from my banks that i have the funds to do this,"" mr. larian said.

a toys ""r"" us spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. a ubs spokeswoman and a bank of america spokesman declined to comment.

it is unclear if other parties are interested in the assets. separately, the toy retailer's bankruptcy attorney said in court wednesday that the firm had received multiple bids of more than $1 billion for a majority stake in its asian business.

mr. larian's bid faces hurdles, including whether other toy companies would want to work directly with a retailer controlled by a competitor, in what is a notoriously secretive and competitive industry. mr. larian said friday that he wouldn't be involved in day-to-day operations at toys ""r"" us were his bid to succeed.

time is also an issue as the company is currently in the process of liquidating its u.s. stores. lawyers for toys ""r"" us will also have to evaluate mr. larian's offer to determine if it is a ""qualified bid"" under the court-approved auction procedures.

mr. larian launched a $1 billion crowdfunding plan last month to save at least a portion of the retail chain. so far the effort has raised $59,000, on top of the $200 million he said he already raised toward the goal from himself and traditional investors. he had set a deadline of may 28 to raise the funds for the bid.

toys ""r"" us filed for bankruptcy protection in september after struggling with more than $5 billion in debt from a leveraged buyout. it also was squeezed by competition from amazon.com inc. as well as by discount retailers such as walmart inc.
